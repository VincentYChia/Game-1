# Game-1 Runtime Dependencies
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Core game engine
pygame>=2.6.0

# Required for crafting classifiers (recipe validation)
numpy>=1.24.0

# Optional: LLM-powered item generation (Claude API)
# Uncomment to enable invented items via API
anthropic>=0.18.0

# Optional: ML classifiers for recipe validation
# TensorFlow for CNN models (Smithing, Adornments)
# tensorflow>=2.15.0
# LightGBM for tabular models (Alchemy, Refining, Engineering)
# lightgbm>=4.0.0

# Note: TensorFlow and LightGBM are optional. The game will run without them
# but ML-based recipe validation will be disabled (fallback to basic validation).
# To enable full ML functionality, uncomment the lines above.

# Note: All other dependencies are Python standard library
# - json (data loading/saving)
# - dataclasses (data models)
# - pathlib (file handling)
# - typing (type hints)
# - enum (constants)
# - random (procedural generation)
# - math (calculations)
# - datetime (timestamps)
