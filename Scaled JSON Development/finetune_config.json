Given an image of a crafting grid and material information, generate a valid item definition.\n\nThe crafting grid shows materials arranged in specific patterns. Each material has properties like tier, category, and tags that influence the output item.\n\nGenerate items that:\n- Have appropriate stats based on material tiers\n- Include relevant tags from the input materials\n- Follow the game's naming conventions\n- Have balanced properties for gameplay",
