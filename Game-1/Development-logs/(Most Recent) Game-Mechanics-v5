# PART IV: PROGRESSION & SYSTEMS

## Progression Systems

### Overview

**Current Implementation:**
- Title definitions are in `titles.json` (all title data including bonuses, prerequisites)
- Skill definitions are in `skills.json` (all 100+ skill definitions)

- **Future:** Even progression curves will become JSON/dynamic when LLM personalizes advancement rates

**Must Be JSON (Even If Using Placeholder Values):**
- `titles.json` - Title definitions AND progression thresholds
- `skills.json` - Skill definitions AND progression curves
- `exp_curves.json` - Character leveling, skill leveling curves
- `title_progression.json` - Acquisition thresholds, RNG chances
- `class_switching.json` - Cost tables by level

---

## Level and Experience

### Character Levels (VERY SLOW - 20 Hours Total)

**Max Level:** 30 (1 stat point per level = 30 total stat points)

**Exponential EXP Requirements:**
```
Level 1 → 2:      200 EXP
Level 2 → 3:      350 EXP
Level 3 → 4:      550 EXP
Level 4 → 5:      800 EXP
Level 5 → 6:    1,100 EXP
...
Level 10 → 11:  3,500 EXP
...
Level 20 → 21: 12,000 EXP
...
Level 29 → 30: 35,000 EXP

Total for Level 30: ~250,000 EXP
Average: ~12,500 EXP per hour
```

### EXP Sources (Exponential by Tier, 4x Multiplier)

**Gathering:**
```
T1 Resource:    10 EXP base
T2 Resource:    40 EXP base (4x)
T3 Resource:   160 EXP base (4x)
T4 Resource:   640 EXP base (4x)

Size Modifiers:
- Small:  0.8x
- Normal: 1.0x
- Large:  1.5x
- Huge:   2.5x

Example: Huge T2 Tree = 40 × 2.5 = 100 EXP per gather
```

**Crafting (Mini-Game ONLY - Instant Craft = 0 EXP):**
```
T1 Recipe:    50 EXP base
T2 Recipe:   200 EXP base (4x)
T3 Recipe:   800 EXP base (4x)
T4 Recipe: 3,200 EXP base (4x)

Performance Multipliers:
- Perfect craft: 2.0x EXP
- First-Try Bonus achieved: 3.0x EXP

Example: Perfect T3 craft = 800 × 2.0 = 1,600 EXP
```

**Discovery:**
```
T1 Recipe Discovery:   100 EXP
T2 Recipe Discovery:   400 EXP
T3 Recipe Discovery: 1,600 EXP
T4 Recipe Discovery: 6,400 EXP

New Material Found: Tier × 100 EXP
New Area Explored: Tier × 200 EXP
Failed Experiment: 10 EXP (encourages trying)
```

**Combat (Placeholder):**
```
T1 Enemy:   100 EXP
T2 Enemy:   400 EXP
T3 Enemy: 1,600 EXP
T4 Enemy: 6,400 EXP

Boss: 10x multiplier
```

**Quests:**
```
Tutorial Quests:   200 EXP
Main Quest T1:     500 EXP
Main Quest T2:   2,000 EXP
Main Quest T3:   8,000 EXP
Side Quests: 50% of main quest value
```

### Auto-Save System

- Game auto-saves character build snapshot at every level
- Snapshots show progression (stats, skills, titles earned)
- Reference only (cannot load old snapshots except pre-class-switch saves)
- Used for LLM analysis and player progression tracking

---

## Skill System

### Core Design

- **Skills are activated effects** (NOT passive bonuses - titles give passives)
- **Frenzy/Burst mechanics** (temporary powerful boosts)
- **Cooldown-based** (can't spam, strategic usage)
- **Consume Mana** (INT-based resource pool)
- **Progress slowly** (late-game EXP sink, slower than character levels)

### Skill Progression

```
Max Skill Level: 10 (Very Slow)

Level 1:   1,000 Skill EXP
Level 2:   2,000 Skill EXP
Level 3:   4,000 Skill EXP
Level 4:   8,000 Skill EXP
...
Level 10: 512,000 Skill EXP

Total to Max: ~1,000,000 Skill EXP per skill
(Much slower than character leveling - late game content)
```

### Skill EXP Sources

```
Using the skill: 100 EXP per activation

Activity while skill active (bonus EXP):
- T1 activity:    20 Skill EXP
- T2 activity:    80 Skill EXP
- T3 activity:   320 Skill EXP
- T4 activity: 1,280 Skill EXP
```

### Mana System

```
Mana Pool:
- Base: 100 mana
- Per INT Point: +20 mana
- Per Character Level: +10 mana

Example (15 INT, Level 20):
100 + (15 × 20) + (20 × 10) = 600 mana

Mana Regeneration:
- Base: 10 mana/minute
- Per INT Point: +2 mana/minute

Example (15 INT):
10 + (15 × 2) = 40 mana/minute
```

### Skill Evolution System

```
Trigger: NPC interaction, special area, major event/milestone
(NOT player-initiated, happens through gameplay)

When Skill Reaches Level 10:
→ Game creates opportunity for evolution
→ Visit specific NPC / Enter special area / Complete event
→ Skill evolves: Resets to Level 0 with enhanced effect

Evolution Chain Example:
Mining Frenzy (Level 10: +100% damage, 60s)
  ↓ (NPC/Event triggers evolution)
Advanced Mining Frenzy (Level 0 → 10: +150% damage, 80s)
  ↓ (NPC/Event triggers evolution)
Expert Mining Frenzy (Level 0 → 10: +200% damage, 100s)
  ↓ (NPC/Event triggers evolution)
Master Mining Frenzy (Level 0 → 10: +300% damage, 120s)
  ↓ (LLM generates unique evolution)
[Custom Skill] - Personalized to player's style
```

**CRITICAL:** Evolution is NOT automatic at level 10. It's triggered by gameplay analysis at major milestones.

**ALL skills can evolve until reaching maximum rarity (legendary)**

### Skill Unlocking

- **Class:** Starts with 1 skill (Level 1)
- **NPCs:** Teach 3-4 skills through quests (guided-play)
- **Discovery:** Find skill books (rare world drops)
- **Achievements:** Some Master titles grant unique skills
- **LLM:** Generate personalized skills (post-guided-play)

### Max Skills

- **Known:** Unlimited (can learn all skills eventually)
- **Equipped:** 6 active at once (hotbar, keyboard 1-6)

---

## Title System

### Core Design

- **Titles give PERMANENT passive bonuses** (always active, never removed)
- **LLM-Generated** (except starter Novice titles which are hardcoded)
- **Progression tiers:** Novice → Apprentice → Journeyman → Expert → Master
- **Prerequisite chains** (mostly, but can skip with extraordinary feats)
- **Hidden titles** (discovery-based, no shown requirements)
- **RARE acquisition** (milestone/event-based with generation chance)

### Title Tiers & Bonuses

#### Novice (Hardcoded - Starter Set)

```
Guaranteed on specific milestones:

• 100 ores mined → "Novice Miner" (+10% mining damage)
• 100 trees chopped → "Novice Lumberjack" (+10% forestry damage)
• 50 T1 items smithed → "Novice Smith" (+10% smithing time)
• 50 materials refined → "Novice Refiner" (+10% forging precision)
• 50 potions brewed → "Novice Alchemist" (+10% alchemy progress)

LLM Generates: "Apprentice Flame Miner"
- Bonus: +25% mining damage
- Special: +15% fire ore discovery chance
- Prerequisite: Novice Miner (required)
- Unique to player's specialization pattern
```

#### Journeyman (LLM-Generated)

```

```

### Title Acquisition Methods

**Primary: Milestone/Event-Based with Generation Chance**
```
Examples of Title Triggers:

Milestone Event: Gather 1,000th ore
→ 20% chance to generate "Apprentice Miner" title

Special Event: Defeat first boss
→ 50% chance to generate "Apprentice Warrior" title

Discovery Event: Find rare material for first time
→ 30% chance to generate title related to discovery

Quest Event: Complete NPC master quest
→ 100% chance to generate specific title
```

**Fallback: Activity Count Guarantees**
```
If RNG hasn't granted title by threshold:

Novice:       1,000 activities (guaranteed if not obtained)
Apprentice:   5,000 activities (guaranteed)
Journeyman:  20,000 activities (guaranteed)
Expert:     100,000 activities (guaranteed)
Master:     500,000 activities OR special achievement (guaranteed)
```

### Title Prerequisite System

```
Standard Chain (Enforced):
Novice Miner (hardcoded)
  ↓ (requires Novice)
Apprentice Miner (LLM, needs Novice)
  ↓ (requires Apprentice)
Journeyman Miner (LLM, needs Apprentice)
  ↓ (requires Journeyman)
Expert Miner (LLM, needs Journeyman)
  ↓ (requires Expert)
Master Miner (LLM, needs Expert)

Skip Conditions (Extraordinary Feats):
IF player does something exceptional:
- Mine 10,000 T4 ores before getting any titles → Skip to Expert
- Discover new mining technique → Skip to Journeyman
- Complete impossible mining challenge → Skip to Master
- LLM evaluates if feat warrants skip

Multiple Paths (Branching):
Novice Miner
  ↓
Apprentice Fire Miner ← Focus fire ores
Apprentice Ice Miner ← Focus ice ores
Apprentice Speed Miner ← Mine super fast
Apprentice Deep Miner ← Mine only T3-T4

Each branch has own progression path
Can pursue multiple branches simultaneously
```

### Hidden Titles (Discovery-Based)

```
No requirements shown
No hints given
Discovered through unique actions

Examples:
• "Dragon's Bane" - Defeat dragon boss with fire weapon
• "Eternal Smith" - Craft 100 items in single session
• "Lucky Bastard" - Get 10 first-try bonuses in a row
• "Material Hoarder" - Store 10,000 unique materials
• "The Undying" - Survive 100 near-death experiences

LLM generates: Title name, bonus, discovery condition
Player discovers through experimentation and play
```

### Title Permanence

```
All Titles are PERMANENT:
- Once earned, ALWAYS active
- Cannot be removed or unequipped
- Bonuses stack infinitely
- No limit to number of titles

Example Character Progression:
Level 5:  "Novice Miner" (+10% mining)
Level 10: "Novice Smith" (+10% smithing)
Level 15: "Apprentice Miner" (+25% mining)
          → Total Mining: +10% + 25% = +35%
Level 20: "Apprentice Warrior" (+25% melee)
Level 30: "Expert Miner" (+100% mining + rare ore bonus)
          → Total Mining: +10% + 25% + 100% = +135%
```

### Title Categories

- **Gathering:** Miner, Lumberjack
- **Crafting:** Smith, Refiner, Alchemist, Engineer, Enchanter
- **Combat:** Warrior, Defender
- **Utility:** Explorer, Survivalist

```
Switching class = Changing active class bonuses

KEPT:
• All character progression (stats, level, EXP)
• All skill levels and EXP
• All titles earned
• All equipped gear
• All inventory items
• All stored materials

CHANGED:
• Class bonuses (old class → new class)
• Starting skill (if applicable)
```

**Switching Cost:**
```
Fixed Cost (Regardless of Level):
- Cost: 1,000 gold
- Purpose: Small gate to prevent constant switching
- Can switch at any time after paying cost
- No cooldown between switches
```

**Simple Confirmation:**
```
Player initiates class switch:

╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗

║ [CANCEL]  [CONFIRM SWITCH]            ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Design Intent:**
- Allow flexible playstyle experimentation
- Minimal cost prevents spam-switching
- No harsh penalties - encourage trying different classes
- Supports build variety and respecialization

---

---

## Equipment Progression

### Tier System

- T1 → T2 → T3 → T4 based on material tier + recipe complexity
- Higher tier materials + larger recipes = more powerful items
- T1 maxed (high rarity + mini-game perfection) can compete with basic T2

### Equipment Types

- **Armor:** Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots, Gauntlets (5 slots)
- **Weapons:** Main Hand, Off Hand
- **Accessories:** 1 slot (rings/amulets/charms from Enchanting)
- **Tools:** Pickaxe slot, Axe slot (quick-swap, not counted in combat slots)

### Upgrade vs Replace

- **Enchanting** upgrades existing gear (adds bonuses, can fail at high tier)
- **Crafting new** replaces old gear (better base stats)
- Both paths viable

---

## Inventory UI

### Inventory System

```
Capacity:
- Base: 20 slots
- STR Bonus: +10 slots per point
- Example: 15 STR = 20 + 150 = 170 slots total

Stack Limits:
- Materials: 256 per slot
- Consumables: 99 per slot
- Equipment/Tools: 1 per slot (no stacking)

Categories (Filtering):
- All Items
- Materials (wood, ore, stone, elementals, monster drops)
- Equipment (armor, weapons, accessories)
- Consumables (potions, food, temporary buffs)
- Tools (pickaxes, axes)
- Recipes (recipe book tab)
```

### UI Layout

**Screen Layout (Placeholder - Subject to UX Design):**
```
Top:
- Health bar (left)
- Mana bar (right)
- Character level and EXP progress

Center:
- Game world (main viewport)
- Resource node health bars (above targeted nodes)
- Enemy health bars (above enemies)
- Damage numbers (floating text)

Bottom:
- Skill hotbar (center, keys 1-6)
- Inventory quick-access (?)

Right Side:
- Quest tracker (toggleable)
- Active buffs/debuffs display

Left Side:
- [Reserved for future features]

No Minimap: Map system not implemented yet
```

---

## Technical Architecture

### Position System (3D-Ready)

```javascript
Position {
  x: float,
  y: float,
  z: float  // Currently 0 for 2D, ready for 3D
}

distance(pos1, pos2) = √[(x₁-x₂)² + (y₁-y₂)² + (z₁-z₂)²]

Current 2D usage: z=0 for both positions
```

### Renderer Abstraction

```javascript
interface IRenderer {
  renderWorld(worldSystem: WorldSystem): void
  renderCharacter(character: Character): void
  renderUI(uiData: any): void
  handleResize(width, height): void
}

// Current: Canvas2DRenderer implements IRenderer
// Future: WebGL3DRenderer implements IRenderer (drop-in replacement)
```

### Asset Management

```javascript
AssetDefinition {
  id: string,
  name: string,
  sprite2D: "path.png",      // Current
  model3D: "path.gltf",      // Future
  color: "#hex",             // Fallback
  scale: number              // 3D scaling
}
```

### Input System

- Mouse → world coordinates via viewport.screenToWorld()
- WASD movement (updates character position)
- Hotkeys 1-6 for skills
- Ready for 3D ray casting (future)

### Save/Load (Placeholder - Needs Implementation)

```
Auto-save triggers:
- Every 5 minutes (background)
- On exit (player quits)
- Before class switch (safety save)
- Every character level (progression snapshot)

Save data includes:
- World state (all tiles, resources, placed objects)
- Player state (position, stats, level, EXP)
- Inventory (all items, quantities)
- Equipment (what's equipped)
- Progression (skills, titles, quest progress)
- Playtime tracking

Format: JSON or binary (TBD based on size/performance)
```

# PART VI: DEVELOPMENT REFERENCE

## JSON Schemas

**⚠️ CRITICAL DISCLAIMER: ALL NUMERICAL VALUES IN THESE TEMPLATES ARE PLACEHOLDERS. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR BALANCED. DO NOT USE THESE NUMBERS IN PRODUCTION. THEY ARE FOR STRUCTURAL REFERENCE ONLY.**

### Items

**Key Specifications:**
- **Range Field:** Physical attack/interaction range (e.g., bow = 10 units, sword = 1 unit), NOT stat ranges
- **Slots/Behavior:** Derived from type/subtype, hardcoded in game logic
- **Crafting Stations:** Just placeable items, no special JSON structure needed
- **Requirements:** Can include level, stats, and titles. Stats/titles requirements should be RARE (most items use level only)
- **Unified Damage Stat:** Tools use same damage field as weapons (mining pickaxe has damage value, not separate mining stat)
- **Narrative First:** Narrative field at top of JSON so LLM processes story/context before mechanics
- **Tradeable:** Everything is tradeable by default, no flag needed
- **Rarity Tiers:** common → uncommon → rare → epic → legendary → mythical → unique
  - **Unique rarity:** Virtually impossible to obtain, devoted players might have 2-3 after a year

**Template:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "narrative": "A simple iron blade with a wooden handle. Every warrior's first step on the path to mastery. The weight feels right in your hand - not perfect, but yours.",
    "tags": ["melee", "starter", "one-handed"]
  },
  
  "itemId": "iron_shortsword",
  "name": "Iron Shortsword",

    "stackable": false,
    "consumable": false,
    "placeable": false,
    "equippable": true,
    "repairable": true
  }
}
```

### Materials

**Key Specifications:**
- **Simplified:** Only essential data, narrative hints at uses
- **Fields:** materialId, name, tier, rarity, category, narrative, tags
- **Removed:** properties object (described in narrative), subCategory, weight, stackSize (hardcoded by category), processingType (all materials refinable if recipe exists), sources (determined by world gen), uses (redundant with narrative)
- **Properties in Narrative:** Material characteristics described naturally ("highly conductive", "extremely brittle", "combustible") rather than as boolean flags

**Template:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "narrative": "Sturdy grey metal from common deposits. Moderately conductive, somewhat malleable when heated. The workhorse of civilization - reliable, abundant, essential for weapons, tools, and armor.",
    "tags": ["basic", "metal", "refined"]
  },
  
  "materialId": "iron_ingot",
  "name": "Iron Ingot",
  "tier": 1,
  "rarity": "common",
  "category": "metal"
}
```

### Recipes

**Key Specifications:**
- **Discipline Separation:** Recipes MUST be separated by crafting discipline (smithing, forging, alchemy, engineering, enchanting)
- **Base Craft vs Mini-Game:** Same recipe supports both. Base craft = instant, no bonuses. Mini-game = randomness + bonuses
- **Mini-Game Recording:** Item metadata records if mini-game was used (greyed out text), not recipe definition
- **Material Matching:** Recipes handle material filtering directly via materialRules (no separate category JSON)
  - Example: `"materialRules": {"slot_1": {"category": "wood", "tier": 1}}` dynamically matches all T1 wood materials

**Template:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "narrative": "The foundational smithing technique - blade, tang, handle. Simple in concept, demanding in execution. Every smith remembers their first sword.",
    "tags": ["weapon", "sword", "starter"]

      "hammeringSp# Game Mechanics - Master Reference Document

## Document Purpose & Status

**Version:** 5.1 MASTER (Updated with Template-Based Chunk System)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Comprehensive Developer Reference

This document serves as the complete design specification for a narrative-driven, LLM-adaptive crafting RPG. It establishes the boundary between hardcoded systems and JSON content, defines all data structures, provides comprehensive guidance for content creation, and details the complete 100×100 development world with all materials, systems, and mechanics.

**Latest Update:** Replaced random chunk generation with 9 predefined chunk templates (Peaceful/Dangerous/Rare variants of Forest/Quarry/Cave themes). Every chunk now has clear narrative identity and purpose.

**Critical Note:** This is a LIVING DOCUMENT. All numerical values are PLACEHOLDERS unless explicitly approved. The structure is final, the numbers are flexible.

# PART I: ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION

## Core Design Principles

### The Golden Rule

**"Hardcode the invariant mechanics, JSON the variable content and values."**

### Hardcode vs JSON Philosophy

**What Gets Hardcoded:**
- System mechanics (HOW things work)
- Formula SHAPES (multiplication order, calculation structure)
- Lookup hierarchy logic (override → tier/category → fallback)
- Core game loops (gathering, crafting, combat)
- Element behavior boundaries (fire never slows, ice can slow AND damage)
- Yield inversion principle (T1 = high yields, T4 = low yields)
- Tool efficiency tables (100%/50%/10% for tier matching)
- Size multiplier tables (0.8x/1.0x/1.5x/2.5x)
- Stat bonus percentages (STR = 5% per point)
- Mini-game mechanics and scoring
- Position/distance calculations
- Grid rendering system
- Equipment slot architecture

**What Goes in JSON:**
- All content definitions (items, materials, recipes, enemies)
- All numerical values (even "foundational" ones like EXP curves)
- Specific multiplier values in formulas
- Exact yield numbers per tier/category
- Material-specific overrides for special cases
- Progression curves (character levels, skill levels, title thresholds)
- Balance values and tuning parameters
- Anything that will become LLM-dynamic (even if hardcoded placeholder now)

**Key Insight:** If a "system rule" contains specific numbers/values that might change or become personalized, it should be JSON even if it feels foundational.

### Design Principles Summary

1. **Simple Rules, Infinite Complexity** - Basic mechanics scale infinitely through data and algorithms
2. **No Hard Caps** - Balance through careful tuning, not artificial limits (except max level 30 for stats)
3. **Player Agency** - Everything optional (mini-games skippable, class switching allowed, skills evolved via gameplay)
4. **3D-Ready Architecture** - All systems support seamless 2D→3D transition
5. **LLM-Enhanced Longevity** - Guided-play establishes patterns, LLM generates infinite personalized content
6. **Specialization Rewards** - Deep focus yields unique personalized content
7. **No Breaking** - Durability declines but never destroys (0% = 50% effectiveness forever)
8. **Multiplicative Scaling** - Stats × Titles × Equipment = exponential power growth
9. **EXP = Engagement** - Only mini-games grant crafting EXP (encourages skilled play)
10. **Placeholder Philosophy** - All numerical values subject to refinement during balance testing

---

## Element Template System

### The Core Principle

**CRITICAL: LLM chooses element → receives that element's template → fills it out.**

Elements are NOT free-form. Each element has a pre-defined template with specific fields. This prevents invalid combinations (fire with slowPercent field doesn't exist) and ensures predictable, balanced gameplay.

### Element Behavior Rules (Hardcoded)

**What Each Element CAN and CANNOT Do:**
- **Fire:** NEVER slows. Can burn (DoT), ignite, spread
- **Ice:** CAN slow AND damage. Can freeze, chill, shatter
- **Lightning:** Can stun and chain. Never slows or burns
- **Void:** Erases but doesn't linger. No DoT, pure instant effect
- **Holy:** Can heal and smite. Light-based, purification
- **Poison:** Can damage over time AND slow. Gradual corruption
- **Vampiric:** ONLY lifesteal element. Drains health, sustains wielder

### Element Templates (Hardcoded Structures)

```javascript
ELEMENT_TEMPLATES = {
  physical: {
    fields: ["damageValue"]
  },
  
  fire: {
    fields: ["damageValue", "damageOverTime", "duration", "chance"]
  },
  
  ice: {
    fields: ["damageValue", "damageOverTime", "slowPercent", "duration", "chance"]
  },
  
  lightning: {
    fields: ["damageValue", "stunDuration", "chance", "chainTargets"]
  },
  
  void: {
    fields: ["damageValue", "erasureChance"]
  },
  
  holy: {
    fields: ["damageValue", "healValue", "smiteDamageBonus", "duration", "chance"]
  },
  
  poison: {
    fields: ["damageValue", "damageOverTime", "slowPercent", "duration", "chance"]
  },
  
  vampiric: {
    fields: ["damageValue", "lifesteelPercent", "drainPerTick", "duration", "chance"]
  }
}
```

### LLM Generation Process

**Step-by-Step:**
1. LLM decides: "This sword should have fire properties"
2. System provides fire template: `{damageValue, damageOverTime, duration, chance}`
3. LLM fills in values: `{damageValue: [25,40], damageOverTime: [8,12], duration: 10, chance: 0.30}`
4. Result: Valid fire attribute with only fire-appropriate fields

### Example Attributes

**Fire Attribute:**
```json
{
  "element": "fire",
  "damageValue": [25, 40],
  "damageOverTime": [8, 12],
  "duration": 10,
  "chance": 0.30
}
```

**Ice Attribute:**
```json
{
  "element": "ice",
  "damageValue": [15, 25],
  "damageOverTime": [3, 6],
  "slowPercent": 0.40,
  "duration": 8,
  "chance": 0.25
}
```

**Vampiric Attribute:**
```json
{
  "element": "vampiric",
  "damageValue": [20, 30],
  "lifesteelPercent": 0.12,
  "drainPerTick": 0.03,
  "duration": 12,
  "chance": 0.15
}
```

### Benefits

✅ LLM can't create invalid combinations  
✅ Each element has exactly the fields it needs  
✅ Code knows exactly what to expect per element  
✅ Clean, predictable structure  
✅ Future expansion supported (add new elements with their own templates)

---

## Text-Based Value System

### The Philosophy

**CRITICAL: All JSON quantity/rate fields use TEXT, not numbers. Hierarchical lookup tables translate to actual values.**

This allows:
- Natural language for LLM ("many logs" not "[8,12]")
- Precise tuning for important materials (ironwood, voidsteel)
- Consistent defaults for standard materials (oak, iron)
- Easy global balance adjustments (change tier tables affects all non-override materials)
- Rarity scales naturally (T1 common = high yields, T4 legendary = low yields)

### Three-Tier Lookup Hierarchy

```
1. Material-Specific Override (hand-crafted materials like ironwood, voidsteel)
   ↓ Not found?
2. Tier + Category Default (T3 woods, T2 ores, etc.)
   ↓ Not found?
3. Global Fallback (error state, shouldn't happen)
```

### How Lookup Works

**Example 1 - Hand-Crafted Material (Has Override):**
```json
{
  "resourceId": "ironwood_tree_ancient",
  "resourceType": "ironwood_log",
  "category": "wood",
  "tier": 3,
  "yields": {
    "materialId": "ironwood_log",
    "baseYield": "several"
  }
}
```
**Lookup:** Check `MATERIAL_OVERRIDES["ironwood_log"]["several"]` → Found: `[4, 7]`

**Example 2 - Standard Material (No Override):**
```json
{
  "resourceId": "oak_tree_large",
  "resourceType": "oak_log",
  "category": "wood",
  "tier": 1,
  "yields": {
    "materialId": "oak_log",
    "baseYield": "several"
  }
}
```
**Lookup:**
1. Check `MATERIAL_OVERRIDES["oak_log"]` → Not found
2. Check `YIELD_TABLES["wood"]["T1"]["several"]` → Found: `[10, 15]`

**Example 3 - Ultra-Rare Outlier (Voidsteel):**
```json
{
  "resourceId": "voidsteel_vein_small",
  "resourceType": "voidsteel_ore",
  "category": "ore",
  "tier": 4,
  "yields": {
    "materialId": "voidsteel_ore",
    "baseYield": "many"
  }
}
```
**Lookup:** Check `MATERIAL_OVERRIDES["voidsteel_ore"]["many"]` → Found: `[2, 4]`

(Even though T4 ore "many" defaults to `[7, 12]`, voidsteel override makes it even rarer)

### Descriptor Categories

**Yield Amount Descriptors:**
- `few`, `several`, `many`, `abundant`, `plentiful`
- Numbers vary by: Material override > Tier + Category > Fallback
- **CRITICAL: Higher tiers yield LESS (rare/valuable), lower tiers yield MORE (common/abundant)**

**Respawn Time Descriptors:**
- `quick`, `normal`, `slow`, `very_slow`, `null` (never)
- Duration varies by: Material override > Category defaults
- Higher tier materials respawn slower (scarcity preservation)

**Drop Chance Descriptors:**
- `guaranteed`, `high`, `moderate`, `low`, `rare`, `improbable`
- Percentages vary by: Material override > Tier defaults
- Higher tiers have lower drop chances (T4 "low" < T1 "low")

**Spawn Density Descriptors:**
- `abundant`, `high`, `moderate`, `low`, `rare`, `improbable`
- **NEVER use "unique" for density**
- Counts vary by: Chunk type + Biome context
- Higher tier materials spawn less frequently

### The Yield Inversion Principle

**CRITICAL BALANCE MECHANIC:**

Higher tier materials are MORE VALUABLE but LESS ABUNDANT. This is reflected in yields:
- **T1 (Common):** High yields ([10-15] logs) - abundant in world, less valuable
- **T2 (Uncommon):** Moderate yields ([7-12] logs) - less common, more valuable
- **T3 (Rare):** Low yields ([5-9] logs) - rare in world, quite valuable
- **T4 (Legendary):** Very low yields ([3-6] logs) - extremely scarce, highly valuable

This creates natural scarcity for high-tier materials without requiring complex spawn reduction. Players get LESS of valuable materials per harvest, preserving their rarity and economic value.

**Exception:** Material overrides can break this pattern when needed (e.g., voidsteel even rarer than T4 defaults, or ancient oak yielding more than standard T3 wood).

### System Benefits

✅ Precise tuning for important materials (ironwood, voidsteel, legendary items)  
✅ Consistent defaults for standard materials (oak, iron use tier/category)  
✅ Easy global balance adjustments (change tier tables, affects all non-override materials)  
✅ Outlier support (voidsteel can be even rarer than T4 defaults)  
✅ Natural language for LLM ("many logs" not "[8,12]")  
✅ Rarity scales naturally (T1 common = high yields, T4 legendary = low yields)

**Implementation Note:** Material overrides stored in `material_overrides.json`, tier/category defaults in `value_translation_tables.json`. Game code performs 3-step lookup at runtime.

---

## System Clarifications

### Title System Structure

**Current Implementation:**
- Title definitions are in `titles.json` (all title data including bonuses, prerequisites)
- Progression curves (Novice = 1000 activities, Apprentice = 5000, etc.) currently hardcoded as placeholder
- **Future:** Even progression curves will become JSON/dynamic when LLM personalizes advancement rates
- **Grouping:** Titles grouped by `titleType` (gathering, crafting, combat) and `difficultyTier` (novice, apprentice, journeyman, expert, master)
- **Balance:** Hardcoded titleType and difficultyTier structures maintain balance across title system

### Skill System Structure

**Current Implementation:**
- Skill definitions are in `skills.json` (all 100+ skill definitions)
- Progression curves (Level 1 = 1000 exp, Level 2 = 2000 exp) currently hardcoded as placeholder
- **Future:** Progression curves will become JSON/dynamic for personalized advancement

**Evolution System:**
- Skill evolution is NOT automatic at level 10
- Skills CAN evolve when they reach level 10, but it's not automatic
- Evolution triggered by: NPC interaction, special area visit, major milestone/event
- Player doesn't initiate - happens through gameplay
- Level 10 is prerequisite, not trigger
- **ALL skills can evolve until reaching maximum rarity (legendary)**
- Evolution path determined by gameplay analysis, not pre-defined in skill JSON

### Progression System

**Currently Hardcoded (Placeholder Values):**
- Character level EXP curve (max 1,000,000 EXP for endgame)
- Skill level EXP curve (rarity-based exponential scaling)
- Title acquisition thresholds
- Class switching costs by level

**Future (Will become JSON/Dynamic):**
- LLM may personalize EXP curves per player
- Skill progression might vary by playstyle
- Title thresholds could adapt to player pace
- Class switching costs might become dynamic

**Therefore:** These should be JSON NOW, even though they use static placeholder values during guided-play.

**Must Be JSON (Even If Using Placeholder Values):**
- `titles.json` - Title definitions AND progression thresholds
- `skills.json` - Skill definitions AND progression curves
- `exp_curves.json` - Character leveling, skill leveling curves
- `title_progression.json` - Acquisition thresholds, RNG chances
- `class_switching.json` - Cost tables by level

# PART II: GAME WORLD & CONTENT

## Vision and Philosophy

### Mission: The Infinite Adaptive World

**Our Vision:** Create a 2D sandbox game that becomes a unique, infinite world for each player - one that understands how they think and adapts accordingly. Whether someone is an analytical optimizer who loves efficiency systems, a creative explorer who seeks discovery, or a social builder who enjoys collaboration, the game should recognize their cognitive style and procedurally generate content that resonates with how their mind works.

### The Infinite Promise

- **Infinite Resources** through procedural material generation
- **Infinite Recipes** via algorithmic combination systems
- **Infinite Territory** through modular world building blocks
- **Infinite Progression** where mastery opens new systems
- **Infinite Personalization** where the game learns player preferences

**Technical Philosophy:** Start with rock-solid, simple foundations (place tiles, craft items, automate systems) but architect every system to scale infinitely through data and algorithms, not code rewrites. Like Minecraft's blocks or No Man's Sky's planets - simple rules creating infinite emergent complexity.

**The Developer Challenge:** Build systems so robust and extensible that in 5 years, players could still be discovering new combinations, new territories, and new possibilities that surprise even us as the creators.

### Development Approach

**Current Phase:** Guided-play prototype (100×100 world, T1-T3 content, hand-crafted recipes establishing baseline patterns)

**Guided-Play Style:** BOTW/Minecraft approach - hints and info bubbles, but complete freedom from the start. No forced tutorial sequences. Easy start with core mechanics, gradually opens to full freedom after 3 NPCs.

**Future Phase:** LLM-driven infinite content generation begins post-guided-play, creating personalized progression, emergent specializations, and unique discoveries based on player behavior patterns.

---

## World Structure

### Development World (100×100 Units)

**Total Playable Area:** 100×100 units
- **Purpose:** Guided-play development region (prototype for larger world)
- **Grid System:** Continuous float positions with snap-to-unit for collision detection
- **3D-Ready Architecture:** All positions use {x, y, z} format where z=0 for 2D (ready for 3D conversion)
- **Future Expansion:** Post-guided-play opens to infinite procedural world generation
- **Boundaries:** None for now (players can walk to edges, system will expand later)

**Why 100×100:**
- Large enough for ~20 hours of guided-play content
- Small enough for performance testing and iteration
- Provides baseline data for LLM training
- Easy to expand without rewriting core systems

### Chunk-Based Generation System

**Chunk Structure:**
- **Chunk Size:** 16×16 units each
- **Total Chunks:** 6×6 grid = 36 chunks (with 4 unit border/padding for roads and transitions)
- **Generation Method:** Template-based with predefined themes (NOT fully random)
- **Seed-Based:** Reproducible world generation using seed values (for save/load consistency)

**Chunk Type Distribution:**

Roll d10 for each chunk during world generation:
```
1-5 = PEACEFUL VARIANTS (50% chance - safe gathering zones)
  Roll d3: 1=Forest, 2=Quarry, 3=Cave
  
6-8 = DANGEROUS VARIANTS (30% chance - high risk/reward)
  Roll d3: 1=Forest, 2=Quarry, 3=Cave
  
9-10 = RARE VARIANTS (20% chance - special themed areas)
  Roll d3: 1=Hidden Forest, 2=Ancient Quarry, 3=Deep Cave

Result: Mix of safe zones, dangerous areas, and special discoveries
```

**Design Rationale:**
- Every chunk has a clear theme and narrative identity
- Peaceful chunks provide safe baseline gathering (50% of world)
- Dangerous chunks reward risk with better nodes and higher tier materials (30%)
- Rare chunks are special discoveries with guaranteed T3 spawns (20%)
- No random mess - each chunk tells a story

---

### Chunk Content Specifications

**PEACEFUL FOREST (Safe Tree Gathering):**

```
Theme: Sunlit groves where ancient oaks stand patient. Safe haven for woodcutters.

Tree Nodes (Very High Density - Primary Resource):
- Oak Trees: 18-24 nodes per chunk (abundant, safe farming)
- Pine Trees: 15-20 nodes per chunk (abundant, alternative)
- Ash Trees: 8-12 nodes per chunk (common here)
- Birch Trees (T2): 4-6 nodes per chunk (uncommon but accessible)
- Maple Trees (T2): 2-4 nodes per chunk (rare T2 access)

Size Distribution:
- Small: 20%
- Normal: 50%
- Large: 25%
- Huge: 5%

### Chunk Generation Rules

**World Generation Process:**
1. For each of 36 chunks, roll d10 to determine category
2. If Peaceful (1-5): Roll d3 for variant (Forest/Quarry/Cave)
3. If Dangerous (6-8): Roll d3 for variant (Forest/Quarry/Cave)
4. If Rare (9-10): Roll d3 for variant (Hidden Forest/Ancient Quarry/Deep Cave)
5. Place spawn area override (center 3×3 chunks forced to Peaceful variants)
6. Generate road connecting spawn to 3 NPC locations
7. Populate each chunk using its template specifications

**Spawn Area Exception:**
- Center 3×3 chunks (9 chunks total) MUST be Peaceful variants
- Mix of Peaceful Forest, Peaceful Quarry, Peaceful Cave
- Ensures new players have safe starting area
- +50% resource density in spawn chunks (tutorial safety)

**Expected World Composition (36 chunks):**
- Spawn Safe Zone: 9 chunks (forced Peaceful)
- Peaceful Variants: ~9 chunks (50% of remaining 27)
- Dangerous Variants: ~8 chunks (30% of remaining 27)
- Rare Variants: ~10 chunks (20% of remaining 27, includes spawn)
- Road: Connects through 3-4 chunks

### The 9 Chunk Templates

**Peaceful Variants (50% of world - Safe gathering zones):**
1. **Peaceful Forest** - Safe tree gathering, low enemy density, abundant Oak/Pine/Ash
2. **Peaceful Quarry** - Safe stone gathering, low enemy density, abundant Limestone/Sandstone/Slate
3. **Peaceful Cave** - Safe metal gathering, low enemy density, abundant Copper/Iron/Tin

**Dangerous Variants (30% of world - High risk/reward):**
4. **Dangerous Forest** - High-tier trees common, high enemy density, larger nodes (25% huge vs 5%)
5. **Dangerous Quarry** - High-tier stones common, aggressive beetles, enhanced elemental drops
6. **Dangerous Cave** - High-tier ores common, high enemy density, larger nodes

**Rare Variants (20% of world - Special discoveries):**
7. **Hidden Forest** - Maximum tree density, guaranteed Ancient Oak (T3), +20% yield buff
8. **Ancient Quarry** - Maximum stone density, guaranteed Crystal Quartz + Obsidian (T3), +30% elemental drops
9. **Deep Cave** - Maximum ore density, guaranteed Mithril + Adamantine (T3), +20% rarity upgrade chance

**World Composition (36 total chunks):**
- Spawn Safe Zone: 9 chunks (forced Peaceful variants)
- Peaceful Zones: ~9 additional chunks
- Dangerous Zones: ~11 chunks  
- Rare Zones: ~7 chunks
- Roads: 3-4 chunks

This creates a world with: safe starting area → challenging exploration → legendary discoveries.

### 🔩 METALS (15 Total)

**Processing Rule:** Type A (Required Refinement) - All metal ores CANNOT be used in recipes directly. Must refine Ore → Ingot at T1+ Refinery before crafting.

#### Tier 1 Metals (Starter/Common)

**Copper Ore → Copper Ingot**
- *"A soft, reddish metal found in shallow veins near the surface. Easy to work with basic tools but lacks the durability needed for serious combat. The foundation of all smithing - every blacksmith's first lesson."*
- **Source:** Metal ore chunks (Grassland common, Ore chunks abundant)
- **Spawn Rate:** Common (4-8 in grassland, 10-15 in ore chunks)
- **Tool Required:** T1 Pickaxe
- **Refining Ratio:** 1 Ore → 1 Ingot (1:1, no material loss)
- **Yield:** several
- **Uses:** Basic tools (low durability), early weapons (low damage), binding components, alloy base (Bronze), decorative items, cheap repairs
- **Notable Property:** Malleable - easy to work with, forgiving for beginner crafters, accepts enchantments readily

**Iron Ore → Iron Ingot**
- *"Sturdy grey metal from common deposits throughout the land. The workhorse of civilization - reliable, abundant, and strong enough for most purposes. If copper is a blacksmith's first lesson, iron is their bread and butter."*

### 🦴 MONSTER DROPS (12 Total - NOTE: Missing 3 T4 materials, needs completion)

**Acquisition Method:** Monster drops are obtained by defeating enemies and looting their corpses. After an enemy is defeated, a corpse entity appears that can be clicked to loot materials. Drops are immediate (no processing needed).

**Processing Rule:** Direct use - monster drops require no processing, ready to craft immediately.

#### Tier 1 Monster Drops (Common Enemies)

**Wolf Pelt**
- *"Thick fur harvested from forest wolves, warm and water-resistant, still carrying the scent of pine needles and predatory musk. The hide beneath is tough leather suitable for padding. Hunters know: a good wolf pelt can mean the difference between frostbite and comfort on a winter hunt."*

## Gathering System

### Core Interaction Loop

**Player → Resource Node Interaction Flow:**
```
1. Player moves near resource node using WASD controls
2. System checks distance: Within 3 unit interaction radius?
3. Player clicks on resource node (mouse click on sprite/hitbox)
4. System validates:
   - Does player have correct tool type equipped? (Axe for trees, Pickaxe for ore/stone)
   - Is tool tier sufficient? (T1 tool can mine T1, struggles with T2+)
5. If valid: Tool "hits" resource
   - Visual: Resource node shakes/vibrates
   - Audio: Impact sound (wood thunk, stone crack, metal clang)
   - Particles: Material-specific particles spawn (wood chips, stone dust, ore sparkles)
   - Damage: Resource health bar depletes based on effective damage calculation
6. Repeat: Player clicks again for next hit (or holds mouse for continuous hitting)
7. Resource health reaches 0:
   - Node destruction animation plays (tree falls, stone crumbles, ore shatters)
   - Materials drop (RNG quantity based on resource size and tier)
   - Materials scatter on ground in 2-3 unit radius around node
   - Materials glow/shimmer for visibility
8. Collection: Player clicks scattered materials (1 unit pickup radius)
   - Materials automatically add to inventory (if space available)
   - Collection sound plays (satisfying chime/pickup noise)
   - Quantity notification appears briefly ("+5 Oak Logs")
9. Node disappears: Resource entity removed from world (no respawn for now)
10. Player continues: Find next resource, repeat loop
```

**Design Philosophy:**
- Click-to-gather feels rewarding (each hit is player action)
- Health bars provide clear progress feedback
- Visual/audio feedback makes gathering satisfying
- Material drop creates micro-moment of "loot collection" excitement
- No respawn creates sense of world impact (you're actually consuming resources)

### Tool Tier Efficiency System

**The Core Formula:**
```
Effective Damage = Base Tool Damage × Tool Tier Efficiency × Stat Multiplier × Title Multiplier × Equipment Multiplier

Where:
- Base Tool Damage: Tier-based flat value (T1 = 10, T2 = 20, T3 = 40, T4 = 80)
- Tool Tier Efficiency: Multiplicative modifier based on resource tier vs tool tier
- Stat Multiplier: 1 + (relevant stat points × stat bonus %)
- Title Multiplier: Cumulative from all earned titles
- Equipment Multiplier: Product of all equipment bonuses
```

**Tool Tier Efficiency Rules:**
```
Gathering SAME Tier Resource (Optimal):
- Efficiency: 100% (no modifier)
- Example: T2 Axe (20 base) vs T2 Tree (200 HP)
  - Effective Damage: 20 × 1.0 = 20 damage/hit
  - Hits to Deplete: 200 HP ÷ 20 = 10 hits
  - Result: Fast, efficient, feels good

Gathering ONE TIER HIGHER Resource (+1, Slow but Viable):
- Efficiency: 50% (half damage)
- Example: T1 Axe (10 base) vs T2 Tree (200 HP)
  - Effective Damage: 10 × 0.5 = 5 damage/hit
  - Hits to Deplete: 200 HP ÷ 5 = 40 hits  
  - Result: 4x slower, significant time investment, but POSSIBLE
  - Design: Allows progression without hard gates, rewards upgrading tools

Gathering TWO+ TIERS HIGHER Resource (+2+, Not Practical):
- Efficiency: 10% (one-tenth damage)
- Example: T1 Axe (10 base) vs T3 Tree (400 HP)
  - Effective Damage: 10 × 0.1 = 1 damage/hit
  - Hits to Deplete: 400 HP ÷ 1 = 400 hits
  - Result: Absurdly slow, not worth attempting
  - Design: Soft blocks progression (technically possible, practically insane)

Gathering LOWER Tier Resources (Efficient Farming):
- Efficiency: 150%+ (bonus damage, overkill)
- Example: T3 Axe (40 base) vs T1 Tree (100 HP)
  - Effective Damage: 40 × 1.5 = 60 damage/hit
  - Hits to Deplete: 100 HP ÷ 60 = 1.67 hits (basically 2 hits)
  - Result: 5x faster than same-tier, trivializes low-tier gathering
  - Design: Returning to starter areas for materials doesn't feel tedious
```

**Why This System Works:**
- **Natural Progression:** Players can attempt higher tiers but it's painful
- **Meaningful Upgrades:** New tools make dramatic difference (10 hits → 2 hits)
- **No Hard Walls:** Can't be permanently stuck (just slow progression)
- **Backtracking Reward:** High-tier tools make low-tier gathering trivial
- **Clear Feedback:** Players FEEL the difference between tier matches

### Resource Health Scaling

**Base Health by Tier (Doubling Pattern):**
```
T1 Resources: 100 HP base
- Oak Tree, Pine Tree, Limestone, Copper Ore, etc.
- Rationale: 10 hits with T1 tool (10 damage × 10 hits = 100 HP)

T2 Resources: 200 HP base (2x)
- Birch Tree, Maple Tree, Granite, Steel Ore, etc.
- Rationale: 10 hits with T2 tool (20 damage × 10 hits = 200 HP)

T3 Resources: 400 HP base (2x)
- Ironwood Tree, Obsidian, Mithril Ore, etc.
- Rationale: 10 hits with T3 tool (40 damage × 10 hits = 400 HP)

T4 Resources: 800 HP base (2x)
- World Tree, Star Crystal, Eternium Ore, etc.
- Rationale: 10 hits with T4 tool (80 damage × 10 hits = 800 HP)
```

**Design Goal:** Same-tier gathering always takes approximately 10 hits (consistent feedback)

### Size Variance (Exponential Scaling)

**Visual Size Categories with Exponential Rewards:**
```
SMALL Resources (0.8x sprite scale):
- HP Modifier: 0.8x (Example: T1 = 80 HP instead of 100 HP)
- Yield Modifier: 0.8x (Example: 3-5 logs instead of 4-6 logs)
- Efficiency: 0.8 HP per material (100 HP ÷ 100 materials = 1:1 ratio)
- Visual: Noticeably smaller sprite
- Rationale: Quick to gather but lower yield, good for emergency materials

NORMAL Resources (1.0x sprite scale):
- HP Modifier: 1.0x (Example: T1 = 100 HP)
- Yield Modifier: 1.0x (Example: 4-6 logs)
- Efficiency: 1.0 HP per material (baseline ratio)
- Visual: Standard sprite size
- Rationale: Most common, balanced risk/reward

LARGE Resources (1.5x sprite scale):
- HP Modifier: 1.5x (Example: T1 = 150 HP)
- Yield Modifier: 1.5x (Example: 7-10 logs)
- Efficiency: 1.0 HP per material (same ratio, but more total)
- Visual: Noticeably larger sprite
- Rationale: Takes 50% longer but gives 50% more (proportional, worth it)

HUGE Resources (2.5x sprite scale):
- HP Modifier: 2.5x (Example: T1 = 250 HP)
- Yield Modifier: 2.5x (Example: 12-18 logs)
- Efficiency: SLIGHTLY BETTER (exponential bonus starts here)
- Visual: Massive sprite, stands out dramatically
- Rationale: Takes 2.5x time but gives 2.5x+ reward (slight efficiency bonus rewards finding huge nodes)
```

**Exponential Scaling Example (T1 Oak Tree):**
```
Small Oak (80 HP):
- Time: 8 hits
- Yield: 3-4 logs average
- Efficiency: 20 HP per log (worse than normal)

Normal Oak (100 HP):
- Time: 10 hits
- Yield: 4-5 logs average
- Efficiency: 22 HP per log (baseline)

Large Oak (150 HP):
- Time: 15 hits
- Yield: 7-9 logs average
- Efficiency: 19 HP per log (slightly better)

Huge Oak (250 HP):
- Time: 25 hits
- Yield: 14-18 logs average
- Efficiency: 16 HP per log (BEST efficiency)
```

**Design Intent:**
- Small nodes: Quick emergency resources but inefficient
- Normal nodes: Balanced, most common
- Large nodes: Worth targeting (same efficiency, more total)
- Huge nodes: BEST efficiency, reward exploration and observation
- Visual feedback: Can identify valuable nodes from distance

### Tool Damage Scaling (Matches Resource Health)

```
T1 Tools: 10 damage per hit
- Example: T1 Pickaxe, T1 Axe
- Result: 10 hits to deplete T1 resource (100 HP ÷ 10 = 10)

T2 Tools: 20 damage per hit (2x)
- Example: T2 Pickaxe, T2 Axe
- Result: 10 hits to deplete T2 resource (200 HP ÷ 20 = 10)

T3 Tools: 40 damage per hit (2x)
- Example: T3 Pickaxe, T3 Axe
- Result: 10 hits to deplete T3 resource (400 HP ÷ 40 = 10)

T4 Tools: 80 damage per hit (2x)
- Example: T4 Pickaxe, T4 Axe
- Result: 10 hits to deplete T4 resource (800 HP ÷ 80 = 10)
```

**Perfect Symmetry:** Tool damage doubles when health doubles, maintaining 10-hit baseline across all tiers.

### Material Yield System (RNG with Luck Influence)

**Yield Ranges by Tier and Size:**
```
T1 Resources:
- Small: 2-4 materials (avg 3)
- Normal: 3-5 materials (avg 4)
- Large: 5-8 materials (avg 6.5)
- Huge: 10-15 materials (avg 12.5)

T2 Resources:
- Small: 3-5 materials (avg 4)
- Normal: 5-7 materials (avg 6)
- Large: 8-12 materials (avg 10)
- Huge: 15-22 materials (avg 18.5)

T3 Resources (proportional increase):
- Small: 5-7 materials
- Normal: 8-10 materials
- Large: 12-18 materials
- Huge: 22-32 materials

T4 Resources (proportional increase):
- Small: 8-12 materials
- Normal: 12-16 materials
- Large: 20-30 materials
- Huge: 35-50 materials
```

**Luck Stat Influence:**
```
Base RNG: Random(min, max) using uniform distribution
Luck Effect: Shifts distribution toward maximum value

Formula: 
final_yield = min + (max - min) × (base_random + LCK_bonus)
where LCK_bonus = LCK_stat × 0.02

Example: Normal T2 Tree (5-7 logs), Player has 15 LCK
- Base roll: Random(0.0 to 1.0) = 0.5
- LCK Bonus: 15 × 0.02 = 0.30
- Adjusted: 0.5 + 0.30 = 0.80 (capped at 1.0)
- Result: 5 + (7-5) × 0.80 = 5 + 1.6 = 6.6 logs → 7 logs (rounded up)

Zero Luck (0 LCK):
- Uniform distribution, equal chance of any value in range
- Average yield over time

High Luck (20+ LCK):
- Heavily biased toward maximum values
- Almost always get max or near-max yields
- Dramatic difference in material accumulation over time
```

**Design Philosophy:**
- Base RNG prevents predictability (keeps gathering interesting)
- Luck stat rewards builds focused on resource acquisition
- High luck builds become "farmer" specialists (gather more per node)
- Still random (never guaranteed), just statistically better

### Complete Gathering Example (With All Multipliers)

**Scenario: Player gathering Huge T2 Birch Tree (500 HP)**

**Player Build:**
- Tool: T2 Axe (20 base damage)
- Stats: 12 AGI (forestry bonus +5% per point)
- Title: Apprentice Lumberjack (+25% forestry)
- Equipment: Forestry Gloves (+10%), no other bonuses
- LCK: 8 (affects yield)

**Damage Calculation:**
```
Base Tool Damage: 20 (T2 Axe)

Tool Tier Efficiency: 1.0 (T2 tool vs T2 resource, perfect match)

Stat Multiplier:
- AGI: 12 points × 5% = +60%
- Multiplier: 1.60

Title Multiplier:
- Apprentice Lumberjack: +25%
- Multiplier: 1.25

Equipment Multiplier:
- Forestry Gloves: +10%
- Multiplier: 1.10

Total Effective Damage:
20 × 1.0 × 1.60 × 1.25 × 1.10 = 44 damage per hit
```

**Hits Required:**
```
Resource HP: 500 (Huge T2 tree = 200 base × 2.5 size)
Damage per Hit: 44
Hits Needed: 500 ÷ 44 = 11.36 hits → 12 hits

Compare to Base (no bonuses):
- Base damage: 20
- Hits needed: 500 ÷ 20 = 25 hits
- Specialized build is MORE THAN 2x faster (12 vs 25 hits)
```

**Yield Calculation:**
```
Huge T2 Tree Base Range: 15-22 logs

Luck Influence (8 LCK):
- LCK Bonus: 8 × 0.02 = 0.16
- Base Roll: Random(0-1) = 0.60 (example)
- Adjusted: 0.60 + 0.16 = 0.76
- Yield: 15 + (22-15) × 0.76 = 15 + 5.32 = 20.32 → 20 logs

Compare to No Luck:
- Average yield: (15+22)/2 = 18.5 logs
- With 8 LCK: Averaging ~19-20 logs (noticeable improvement)
```

**Total Result:**
- Hits: 12 (vs 25 base, 52% faster)
- Yield: 20 logs (vs 18.5 average, 8% more)
- Time Saved: If each hit takes 0.5 seconds, saves 6.5 seconds per tree
- Over 100 trees: Saves 650 seconds (10+ minutes of clicking)

**Design Validation:**
- Specialization feels VERY rewarding (dramatic time savings)
- Stats, titles, equipment all stack multiplicatively (big numbers)
- Luck provides consistent edge (not random spikes, steady improvement)
- High-investment builds pay off clearly

### Visual & Audio Feedback

**During Gathering (Per Hit):**
```
Visual Feedback:
- Resource node shakes/vibrates (0.2 second duration)
- Particle effects spawn at impact point:
  - Trees: Wood chips (brown/tan particles, scatter outward)
  - Stone: Dust clouds (gray/white particles, puff upward)
  - Ore: Sparkles (metallic glints, shimmer effect)
- Health bar appears above node:
  - Red bar depleting left to right
  - Current HP / Max HP displayed numerically
  - Bar color changes based on % (green > yellow > orange > red)
- Critical Hit (if triggered):
  - Larger particle burst
  - Screen shake (subtle, 1 pixel)
  - "CRIT!" text popup with damage number
  - Different impact sound (deeper/louder)

Audio Feedback:
- Impact sound varies by material:
  - Wood: Solid "thunk" (satisfying chop)
  - Stone: Sharp "crack" (brittle break)
  - Ore: Metallic "clang" (mining ring)
- Volume scales with damage dealt (higher damage = louder)
- Critical hits play enhanced sound effect
- Pitch variation (slight random pitch shift prevents monotony)
```

**On Resource Depletion (Node Destroyed):**
```
Visual Feedback:
- Destruction animation:
  - Trees: Fall in random direction, fade out during fall
  - Stone: Crumble into pieces, pieces sink into ground
  - Ore: Shatter with sparkle burst, fragments disappear
- Materials drop:
  - Items spawn at node position
  - Scatter in 2-3 unit radius (random positions)
  - Items appear with "pop-in" animation (scale from 0 to 1)
  - Glow effect around items (make them obvious)
  - Shimmer particles above items (draw attention)
- Experience gain notification:
  - "+10 EXP" floats upward from node position
  - Fades out while floating (3 second duration)

Audio Feedback:
- Destruction sound:
  - Trees: Timber creak → crash (satisfying fall)
  - Stone: Heavy crumble (boulder break)
  - Ore: Crystal shatter (high-pitch tinkle)
- Material drop sound: Soft "plink" as items hit ground
- Experience chime: Pleasant notification tone
```

**Material Collection (Pickup):**
```
Visual Feedback:
- Item highlights when mouse hover (outline glow)
- On click: Item flies toward player character
  - Parabolic arc animation (looks natural)
  - Scales down during flight (perspective)
  - Disappears when reaching player
- Inventory slot briefly highlights (item added)
- If inventory full: Red "X" appears, item stays on ground

Audio Feedback:
- Collection chime: Pleasant "ding" or "pop" sound
- Different pitch per material type (wood lower, ore higher)
- If inventory full: Error "bonk" sound

Text Feedback:
- Quantity notification appears briefly:
  - "+5 Oak Logs" (material name + quantity)
  - Position: Above player character or bottom-center screen
  - Duration: 2 seconds, fades out
  - Stacks if collecting multiple materials quickly
```

**Critical Hit System (Luck-Based):**
```
Trigger Chance:
- Base: 5% chance per hit
- LCK Bonus: +2% per LCK point
- Example: 15 LCK = 5% + 30% = 35% crit chance

Critical Effect:
- Damage: 2x normal damage (before multipliers)
- Visual: Enhanced particle burst, screen shake
- Audio: Deeper/louder impact sound
- Text: "CRIT!" popup with yellow damage number

Design Purpose:
- Adds excitement to repetitive clicking
- Rewards LCK builds (high crit chance)
- Occasional fast node depletion (satisfying surprise)
- Makes gathering feel less monotonous
```

### Interaction Range & Position System

**Position Architecture (3D-Ready):**
```javascript
Position Object Structure:
{
  x: float  // World X coordinate (continuous, sub-unit precision)
  y: float  // World Y coordinate (continuous)
  z: float  // World Z coordinate (currently 0 for 2D, ready for 3D)
}

Distance Calculation (3D formula, works in 2D when z=0):
distance(pos1, pos2) = √[(x₁-x₂)² + (y₁-y₂)² + (z₁-z₂)²]

Current 2D Usage:
distance(pos1, pos2) = √[(x₁-x₂)² + (y₁-y₂)²]
(z components ignored since z=0 for both)
```

**Interaction System:**
```
Player Position: Continuous float coordinates
- Example: Player at (47.3, 52.8, 0)
- Moves smoothly between units
- WASD controls update position in small increments (0.1 units per frame)

Resource Node Position: Snap-to-grid integer coordinates
- Example: Tree at (48, 53, 0)
- Always positioned on whole number coordinates
- Makes pathfinding and collision simpler

Interaction Range Check:
IF distance(player_pos, node_pos) <= 3.0 THEN
  node is interactable (highlight, can click)
ELSE
  node not interactable (grayed out, cannot click)

Visual Feedback:
- Nodes within range: Full color, outline glow on hover
- Nodes out of range: Slightly dimmed, no interaction possible
- Range indicator: Optional circle around player (3 unit radius, toggle in settings)
```

**Snap-to-Grid for Collision:**
```
Movement Collision Detection:
1. Player tries to move from (47.3, 52.8) to (47.4, 52.8)
2. System checks "snap position": floor(47.4, 52.8) = (47, 52)
3. Check if tile (47, 52) is solid/occupied
4. If clear: Allow movement to (47.4, 52.8)
5. If blocked: Prevent movement, player stays at (47.3, 52.8)

Design Rationale:
- Continuous float positions = smooth movement
- Snap-to-grid collision = simple, predictable physics
- Resources on grid = easy pathfinding
- Ready for 3D (just add z-axis checks)
```

**Visual Range Indicator:**
```
Optional UI Element (can be toggled):
- Circle drawn around player (3 unit radius)
- Shows exact interaction range
- Helps new players understand mechanics
- Can be disabled in settings for cleaner visuals
```

### Tool Durability Consumption

**Simple 1:1 System:**
```
Each resource hit = 1 durability consumed

Example:
T2 Tree (200 HP) with T2 Axe (20 damage):
- Requires 10 hits to deplete
- Consumes 10 durability

Result: Predictable, easy to understand
```

**Durability Ranges by Tier:**
```
T1 Tools: 500 durability
- Can harvest ~50 same-tier resources
- Breaking should be rare for new players

T2 Tools: 1,000 durability  
- Can harvest ~50 same-tier resources
- Higher tier = more durable

T3 Tools: 2,000 durability
- Can harvest ~50 same-tier resources
- Very durable, long-lasting

T4 Tools: 4,000 durability
- Can harvest ~50 same-tier resources
- Extremely rare to break
```

**Wrong Tool Penalty:**
```
Using pickaxe in combat = 2x durability drain
Using sword to mine = 5x durability drain (or impossible)

Design: Encourages using right tool for job
```

**0% Durability Behavior:**
```
Tool never breaks completely
At 0% durability: Functions at 50% effectiveness
- T2 Axe at 0%: 10 damage instead of 20 damage
- Still usable, just slower
- Can repair at any time

Philosophy: No punishment for running out, just inefficiency
```

**Repair System:**
```
Where: Workstations only (appropriate discipline)
Cost: 20% of original crafting materials
Preserves: All mini-game bonuses and attributes
Time: Instant (no mini-game for repairs)

Example:
T2 Iron Pickaxe repair from 0% to 100%:
- Original cost: 5 Iron Ingots, 2 Oak Planks
- Repair cost: 1 Iron Ingot, 1 Oak Plank (20%)
- Keeps: +15% mining speed from mini-game craft
```

## Resource Nodes

### Node Definition Structure

**Key Specifications:**
- **Qualitative Descriptors:** Use words not numbers
  - Yields: "few", "several", "many", "abundant", "plentiful"
  - Respawn: "quick", "normal", "slow", "very_slow", null
  - Chance: "guaranteed", "high", "moderate", "low", "rare", "improbable"
- **Hardcoded Lookup:** Numbers determined by hardcoded tables based on qualitative descriptors
- **Size Variation:** resourceId defines base type, size (small/normal/large/huge) rolled at spawn time
- **LLM Materials:** Only hand-crafted materials get resource nodes; LLM materials obtained through crafting/drops/quests

### Example Resource Node

**Oak Tree Node:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "narrative": "Ancient oak standing patient as centuries pass. Dense, reliable wood - the foundation of countless structures.",
    "tags": ["tree", "wood", "common"]
  },
  
  "resourceId": "oak_tree",
  "name": "Oak Tree",
  "category": "tree",
  "tier": 1,

# PART III: CRAFTING SYSTEMS

## Crafting Overview

### General Overview

1. **Core Concept:** Material-driven mini-games where recipe complexity and material value determines challenge difficulty and potential rewards. Specializations emerge from material usage patterns (e.g., using many fire materials adds fire modifiers to mini-games, enabling fire-focused sub-specializations).

2. **LLM Role:** Generates new recipes and materials for ANY TIER as long as recipe is unknown to player. T4 is maximum tier (9x9 grid limit), but quality continues through rarity system. Players receive message when discovering LLM-generated recipes ("You've discovered something new!"). NO messages for mini-game quality bonuses on standard recipes. 
   - **Standardization**: Most players at most levels experience standardized content (guided-play recipes)
   - **Custom Content**: Only at highest end (T4 + high rarity + complex specializations) does LLM create truly personalized items/recipes for individual player profiles
   - **Tier vs Quality**: Tier = complexity/grid size. Rarity = quality within tier. Both matter for endgame.

3. **Guided-Play Foundation:** 
   - **Style**: BOTW/Minecraft approach - hints and info bubbles, but complete freedom
   - **Initial Quest**: Direct player to first city/NPC (NPCs as placeholders for cities)
   - **Gating**: First 3 cities/NPCs have soft gates, then gradually opens to full freedom
   - **Tutorial Vibe**: Easy start with core mechanics, but no forced tutorial sequences
   - **Content Volume**: Large handcrafted dataset acts as "training data" for LLM
     - Every material used in minimum 1 recipe, most in 2+ recipes
     - Lower tier materials appear in progressively more recipes
     - Establishes baseline material interactions and trends

4. **Sub-Specialization Mechanics:** Modifications to base mini-game based on material patterns. Example: Base game = click green squares in time limit. Earth specialization = larger click zones. Fire specialization = shorter time limit. Water specialization = irregular shapes. *Note: These are placeholder concepts, actual mechanics TBD.*

5. **Crafting Time & Instant Craft Option:** 
   - Simpler recipes = faster mini-games
   - ALL items can be instantly crafted with recipe + materials (base stats only)
   - Mini-games add +X bonus stats/attributes to base item
   - Higher tier items have higher potential +X bonuses
   - Both base stats and +X bonuses are procedurally generated

6. **Item Metadata Display:**
   - **Prominent Info (Non-Greyed)**: Stats, attributes, effects, narrative description
   - **Technical Info (Greyed Out)**: Material quality details
     - Example: "Blade forged from Legendary Steel (T2) with Common Oak Handle (T1)"
     - Shows tier mixing and rarity mixing in recipe
   - **Always Visible**: Metadata permanently displayed on item inspection

7. **Durability & Maintenance System:**
   - **100% → 50% Durability**: Item functions at full stats
   - **50% → 0% Durability**: Item stats gradually decline to 75% effectiveness
   - **0% Durability**: Item functions infinitely at 50% effectiveness (never breaks completely)
   - **Wrong Tool Usage**: Drains durability faster
     - Mining Pickaxe used in combat = faster durability loss
     - Battle Sword used for mining = major durability drain
   - **Tool Affinities**: 
     - Correct use = normal durability drain
     - Minor wrong use (T3 Pickaxe as weapon) = increased drain
     - Major wrong use (Sword for mining) = severe drain or impossible
   - **Maintenance**: Repair items to restore durability (separate system TBD)

8. **Failure States & Attempts:**
   - Failure loses some resources (scales with recipe tier/complexity)
   - Multiple attempts allowed (3 attempts?)
   - All attempts have same reward calculation
   - **First-Try Bonus:** Chance-based unique attribute class, only available on first attempt (not guaranteed, adds incentive)

9. **Recipe Discovery & Unlocking:**
   - Guided-play recipes: Given through hints, NPC dialogue, or recipe book
   - Post-guided-play recipes: Experimentation required for non-standard recipes
   - LLM recipes: Discovered through trying unknown material combinations
   - Once unlocked, can be base-crafted (no +X) or mini-game crafted (+X bonuses)
   - Set attributes may exist on items regardless, but mini-games can boost them

### Material Economy & Cross-Discipline Overlap

#### **Venn Diagram Philosophy**

All five crafting disciplines (Smithing, Forging, Alchemy, Engineering, Enchanting) share a unified material economy with intentional overlap:

```
Material Overlap Tiers:

CORE MATERIALS (Center of Venn Diagram - ALL 5 disciplines):
- Basic Metals: Iron Ore, Copper Ore, Tin
- Basic Wood: Oak, Pine, Ash
- Basic Binding: Plant Fiber, Leather Strips, Sinew
- Basic Stone: Limestone, Granite
- Used in every crafting discipline in some form

COMMON MATERIALS (Overlap 3-4 disciplines):
- Elemental Crystals: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Lightning, Ice
- Processed Metals: Iron Ingots, Steel, Bronze Alloys
- Quality Wood: Birch, Maple, Ironwood
- Refined Materials: Treated Leather, Polished Stone, Crystal Dust
- Used in most crafting, different applications per discipline

MID-TIER MATERIALS (Overlap 2-3 disciplines):
- Special Alloys: Mithril, Adamantine, Orichalcum
- Rare Crystals: Dragon Scales, Phoenix Feathers, Void Essence
- Advanced Components: Gears, Mechanisms, Power Cores
- Exotic Wood: Ebony, Ancient Wood, Petrified Wood
- Used in specific combinations, niche applications

SPECIALTY MATERIALS (Unique to 1 discipline - Outer edges):
- Discipline-specific reagents and components
- Extremely rare, unique crafting applications
- Examples TBD during guided-play design
- Minimal unique materials - most overlap
```

#### **Cross-Discipline Material Examples**

**Iron (Core Material - Used Everywhere):**
- **Smithing**: Weapon blades, armor plates, tool heads
- **Forging**: Refined into steel, alloyed with other metals, elemental infusion
- **Alchemy**: Iron filings as catalyst, iron-based strength potions
- **Engineering**: Turret frames, bomb casings, structural components
- **Enchanting**: Metal base for enchantments, iron accessories

**Fire Crystal (Common Material - 4-5 Disciplines):**
- **Smithing**: (via Forging) Fire-infused weapons directly
- **Forging**: Create Fire Steel, Fire Copper, elemental metals
- **Alchemy**: Fire damage potions, fire resistance elixirs, heat-based recipes
- **Engineering**: Incendiary bombs, flame turrets, thermal devices
- **Enchanting**: Fire enchantments, burning effects, heat patterns

**Wood (Core Material - Used Everywhere):**
- **Smithing**: Weapon handles, shield frames, bow construction
- **Forging**: Fuel source, refined into charcoal, treated wood materials
- **Alchemy**: Fuel for brewing, container material, wood-based reagents
- **Engineering**: Device casings, structural frames, insulation
- **Enchanting**: Wooden charms, staffs, natural-element accessories

**Dragon Scale (Mid-Tier Material - 2-3 Disciplines):**
- **Smithing**: Premium armor plating, legendary weapon components
- **Forging**: Legendary alloy creation, extreme refinement catalyst
- **Alchemy**: Power potions, transmutation elixirs, high-tier recipes
- **Enchanting**: Dragon-aspect enchantments, high-power patterns
- **Engineering**: Might not use (or very specific applications)

**Gears (Mid-Tier Material - 2-3 Disciplines):**
- **Smithing**: Complex weapon mechanisms, advanced tool construction
- **Engineering**: Turret mechanisms, bomb triggers, device internals
- **Enchanting**: Clockwork accessories, mechanical-themed enchantments
- **Forging/Alchemy**: Generally not used

#### **Design Benefits**

1. **Unified Economy**: All crafters hunt for same core materials
2. **Market Interdependence**: Excess iron useful for multiple disciplines
3. **Flexible Specialization**: Can switch disciplines without wasted materials
4. **Shared Progression**: Advancing in one discipline helps others
5. **Discovery Rewards**: Finding rare materials benefits multiple playstyles
6. **Reduced Complexity**: Players don't need to track 5 separate material pools
7. **Natural Trading**: Players have valuable materials for disciplines they don't use

#### **Specialty Material Philosophy**

- Only 5-10% of materials are discipline-unique
- Unique materials are high-tier or extremely specific
- Core progression uses shared materials
- Specialization comes from recipes and techniques, not exclusive materials
- Example unique materials TBD during guided-play design

## Smithing

### Base Mechanic
Temperature management + hammering/forging

### Workbench Tier System

- **T1 Forge (3x3 grid)**: Basic weapons, simple recipes
- **T2 Forge (5x5 grid)**: Intermediate weapons, unlocks larger weapon types (longswords, battleaxes)
- **T3 Forge (7x7 grid)**: Advanced weapons, unlocks heavy weapons (greatswords, warhammers)
- **T4 Forge (9x9 grid)**: Master weapons, unlocks exotic weapons (halberds, special items)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Higher tier benches can craft ALL lower tier recipes
- **Recipe Size = Power**: Larger recipes (more materials) produce better items, even with same-tier materials

### Triple Gating System

- **Workbench Gate**: Weapon types locked by bench tier (greatsword needs T2+ bench)
- **Recipe Complexity**: Recipe grid size determines item power/quality potential
- **Material Tier**: Material quality affects base stats
- **Example**: Copper greatsword (T1 materials) in 5x5 recipe (T2 bench) = powerful T1 weapon

### Tool vs Weapon System

- **Separate Tools with Affinities**: Mining Pickaxe, Forestry Axe, etc. are distinct from weapons
- **Cross-Purpose Usage**: Tools can fight, weapons can gather (with penalties)
- **Affinity Examples**:
  - T3 Mining Pickaxe = T2 Weapon equivalent damage (but worse than actual T2 weapon)
  - Using pickaxe in combat = faster durability drain
  - Using sword to mine = severe durability drain or impossible
- **Dual Purpose Balance**: Highest tier tools comparable to mid-tier weapons (not equal-tier)

### Elemental Integration

- **Material-Determined**: Fire Crystals in recipe automatically create Fire Sword
- **Quantity Scaling**: 
  - 1 Fire Crystal = minor fire damage bonus
  - 3+ Fire Crystals = moderate fire specialization
  - 5+ Fire Crystals = major fire specialization with unique attributes
- **No Separate Elemental Recipes**: Elements emerge from material choices

### Mini-Game Structure

- **Temperature:** Keyboard controls (WASD/arrows)
- **Hammering/Forging:** Mouse controls (clicking)
- **Difficulty Scaling:**
  - T1: Simple timing with spacebar + click
  - T2: WASD temperature zones + clicking different forge spots
  - T3-T4: OSU-style complexity with rhythm, precision, multi-tasking
- Combines click timing with spatial awareness

### Progression Formula
Based on workbench tier + recipe size + material tier + rarity. Target: Max complexity T1 recipe ≈ Simple T3 recipe (excluding special abilities)

### Time Requirements
15-120 seconds depending on tier and complexity (exact timing TBD through playtesting)

---

## Forging Refining

**Core Purpose:** Primary source for elemental materials, alloy creation, and material quality enhancement. Enables "anything + anything" combinations for infinite experimentation.

### Base Mechanic
Lockpicking-style timing game - "unlocking" the potential of materials through cylinder alignment

### Workbench Tier System (Hub and Spoke)

- **T1 Refinery**: 1 Core Slot + 2 Surrounding Slots
- **T2 Refinery**: 1 Core Slot + 4 Surrounding Slots
- **T3 Refinery**: 2 Core Slots + 5 Surrounding Slots
- **T4 Refinery**: 3 Core Slots + 6 Surrounding Slots
- **All Slots Stackable**: Up to 256 items per slot
- **Fuel Slot**: Separate optional slot for minigame buffs only

### Slot Rules & Core Mechanics

- **Core Slots**: Determine output type and quantity (stackable to 256)
- **Surrounding Slots**: All identical, position doesn't matter (stackable to 256)
- **Multi-Core Rule**: All core slots MUST have equal quantities
  - Valid: Core 1 = 32, Core 2 = 32 → Output = 32
  - Invalid: Core 1 = 32, Core 2 = 16 → Recipe won't process
- **Core Quantity = Output Quantity**: Amount in core determines output amount
  - Example: 64 Iron Ore in core → 64 Iron Ingot output
  - Exception: Rarity upgrades use ratio (64 → 16 for 4:1 ratio)

### Material Refinement Types

**Type A: Required Refinement (Vertical - Enables Use)**
- Raw ore cannot be used in crafting, must refine to ingot
- Example: Copper Ore → Copper Ingot (1:1 ratio, instant without minigame)

**Type B: Optional Quality Refinement (Vertical - Better Stats)**
- Can use raw material, but refined is significantly better
- Example: Raw Wood vs Treated Wood (both usable, treated has +durability)

**Type C: Horizontal Refinement (Different, Not Better)**
- Refinement changes properties, not power level
- Example: Raw Ruby (high power, unstable) vs Refined Ruby (moderate power, stable)
- Example: Soft Leather (mobility) vs Hardened Leather (defense)
- Use case dependent: Neither is objectively better

**Type D: Rarity Refinement (Vertical - Exponential Cost)**
- Single-ingredient rarity upgrades with exponential material loss
- Placeholder Ratio: 4:1 per rarity tier (subject to guided-play balance)
- Example Path: 1024 Iron Ingot → 256 Uncommon → 64 Rare → 16 Epic → 4 Mythic → 1 Legendary
- Capped at Legendary for single-ingredient refinement
- Total cost example: 4,096 Iron Ore for 1 Legendary Iron Ingot

**Type E: Multi-Material Fusion (Combination Effects)**
- Can change item type + rarity + attributes + tier simultaneously
- Better ratios than single-ingredient (encourages complexity)
- Example: 16 Rare Iron + 16 Rare Steel + 8 Fire Crystal → 16 Epic Fire Steel
- "Anything + Anything" possible: metals, woods, gems, leather, etc.

### Elemental Material Creation (Primary Purpose)

- **Elemental Metals**: Fire Steel, Ice Copper, Lightning Iron, etc.
- **Elemental Woods**: Crystal Maple, Flame Oak, Frost Birch, etc.
- **Elemental Everything**: Any base material + elemental additive = elemental variant
- Created through multi-material recipes with elemental crystals/cores
- Example Recipe:
  ```
  Core: 32 Steel Ingot
  Slot 1: 16 Fire Crystal
  Slot 2: 4 Stabilizer
  Result: 32 Fire Steel Ingot (+fire damage, +heat resistance)
  ```

### Alloy Creation

- Requires T3+ Refinery (multi-core slots)
- Equal parts rule: All cores must have same quantity
- Example: Core 1 = 16 Copper, Core 2 = 16 Tin → 16 Bronze
- Different ratios create different alloys:
  - 50/50 Copper/Tin = Balanced Bronze
  - 70/30 via slots = Copper-Heavy Bronze (different stats)
- Complex Alloys (T4):
  ```
  Core 1: 8 Steel
  Core 2: 8 Mithril
  Core 3: 8 Adamantine
  Slot 1: 4 Fire Core
  Slot 2: 4 Dragon Scale
  Result: 8 Prismatic Alloy (legendary triple-metal fusion)
  ```

### Fuel System (Minigame Only)

- **Base Processing**: Instant, no fuel required, guaranteed output (no minigame)
- **Fuel Purpose**: Optional buffs for minigame attempts only
- **Fuel Types & Effects**:
  - Coal (T1): +10% timing window
  - Refined Coal (T2): +20% window, +1 allowed failure
  - Magma Core (T3): +30% window, +2 failures, +10% fire recipe success
  - Void Crystal (T4): +50% window, +3 failures, +15% all recipe success
  - Elemental Fuels: Matching element bonuses (Frost = slower rotation, etc.)
- Fuel consumed per minigame attempt, not per batch

### Mini-Game Structure (All-or-Nothing)

**Success/Failure Only (No Gradient):**
- Success: Full designed output + rarity upgrade (if applicable) + attributes
- Failure: 50% material loss (configurable), no output, must retry
- No partial success or reduced quality output

**Difficulty Variables:**
- **Time Allowed**: 10-60 seconds based on recipe complexity
- **Cylinder Count**: 2-15+ alignments required
- **Timing Window**: 0.1-1.0 seconds per cylinder
- **Allowed Failures**: 0-3 missed timings before total failure
- **Additional Modifiers**:
  - Rotation speed variations
  - Direction changes mid-game
  - Multiple speeds simultaneously
  - Visual effects/obscuration
  - Shrinking windows over time

**Example Difficulty Tiers:**
- Easy (T1 basic): 45s, 3 cylinders, 0.8s window, 2 failures allowed
- Medium (T2 elemental): 30s, 6 cylinders, 0.5s window, 1 failure allowed
- Hard (T3 rarity): 20s, 10 cylinders, 0.3s window, 0 failures (perfect required)
- Extreme (T4 fusion): 15s, 15 cylinders, 0.2s window, 0 failures, multi-speed

### Processing Time

- **Base Crafting (No Minigame)**: Instant, guaranteed success
- **Minigame Crafting**: Varies by difficulty (10-60 seconds of active play)
- No passive waiting time, all processing is immediate

### Important Disclaimers

- All numerical ratios (4:1 rarity, material quantities, fuel bonuses) are PLACEHOLDERS
- Guided-play recipes will define actual values during balance testing
- System structure is final, numbers are flexible
- Recipe complexity and requirements defined per-recipe basis

---

## Alchemy

**Core Purpose:** Universal consumable creation system. No distinction between "potions" and "food" - all are consumables with buffs/effects. Same mechanics, different aesthetic (cauldron for potions, pot for food).

### Base Mechanic
Reaction chain management - reading visual cues to identify optimal timing for ingredient additions

### Station Tier System

- **T1 Alchemy Station**: 3 Ingredient Slots
- **T2 Alchemy Station**: 5 Ingredient Slots
- **T3 Alchemy Station**: 7 Ingredient Slots
- **T4 Alchemy Station**: 9 Ingredient Slots
- **All Slots Identical**: No categorization (base/modifier/catalyst), just numbered ingredient slots
- **Order Matters**: When ingredients are added affects outcome
- **Simultaneous Addition**: Multiple ingredients can be added together at same moment
- **All Slots Stackable**: Up to 256 items per slot

### Rarity & Tier System

**Tier = Efficacy (Power & Duration)**
- Higher tier = stronger effect numbers and longer durations
- Example: T1 Fire Resist = -50% for 2:00, T4 = -95% for 4:00
- Tier determined by recipe and materials used

**Rarity = Effect Complexity (Types & Combinations)**
- Common: Single effect
- Uncommon: Two complementary effects
- Rare: Multiple effects with synergies
- Epic: Complex effects with conditional bonuses
- Mythic: Advanced conditional effects and powerful combos
- Legendary: Ultimate effect combinations with dual-state bonuses
- Higher rarity = more effects, better synergies, conditional bonuses

**Output Rarity Rule**: Capped at highest ingredient rarity used
- Rare ingredients max → Rare output max
- Legendary ingredients → Legendary output possible
- Cannot skip rarity tiers through skill alone

### Gradient Success System (NOT All-or-Nothing)

**Progress-Based Quality:**
```
0-25%: Complete Failure (no output, 50% materials lost)
25-50%: Weak Success (50% duration, 50% effect strength)
50-75%: Standard Success (75% duration, 75% effect strength)
75-90%: Quality Success (100% duration, 100% effect strength)
90-99%: Superior Success (120% duration, 110% effect strength)
100%: Perfect Success (150% duration, 125% effect strength)
```

**For Instant Effects (Healing):**
- Progress directly scales effect magnitude
- 50% progress = 50% healing, 100% = full healing, Perfect = 150% healing

**Handcrafting Bonus (Unique to Alchemy):**
- Unlike other crafting (which gives +stats/attributes), Alchemy handcrafting can boost TIER
- Perfect execution: Output can be effectively T2.5 instead of T2 (stronger numbers)
- Poor execution: Gradient decline in tier effectiveness
- Base crafting (no minigame): Always produces T-level output, no bonus possible

### Effect Stacking Rules

- **Different Effects**: Stack fully, timers independent
- **Same Effect, Different Tiers**: Stack (T1 Fire Resist + T2 Fire Resist = both active)
- **Same Effect, Same Tier**: Don't stack - longest remaining timer overwrites
- Example: Can have Fire Resist + Fire Damage + Healing all active simultaneously

### Reaction Chain Minigame

**Core Loop:**
1. Load ingredients into slots (pre-minigame)
2. Start brewing (timer begins)
3. Add first ingredient → reaction begins
4. Watch reaction grow through stages
5. Either CHAIN (add next ingredient) or STABILIZE (end process)
6. Chaining: Locks current reaction, starts new reaction with next ingredient
7. Stabilizing: Locks current reaction, completes recipe
8. Total progress = sum of all locked reaction qualities

**Reaction Growth Stages (Every Ingredient):**

**Stage 1: Initiation (Early)**
- Visual: Small bubble, dim glow, gentle
- Progress: 5% (very weak)
- Player trap: "It's starting, should I add next one?"
- Reality: TOO EARLY

**Stage 2: Building (False Peaks)**
- Visual: Growing bubble, brightening, pulsing begins
- Progress: 15-20% (improving but not optimal)
- Contains FALSE PEAKS that look promising but aren't sweet spot
- Player trap: "It's glowing! This looks good!"
- Reality: STILL TOO EARLY - looks good but hasn't peaked
- Beginners add next ingredient here

**Stage 3: SWEET SPOT (Optimal)**
- Visual: Optimal size, steady intense glow, rhythmic pulse, saturated color
- Audio: Strong resonant bubbling tone
- Progress: 30-35% (OPTIMAL)
- Distinct from Stage 2: sustained vs spiking, harmonic audio, stable size
- Reality: TARGET WINDOW - experienced players recognize this

**Stage 4: Degrading (Late)**
- Visual: Irregular expansion, flickering glow, darkening edges
- Audio: Popping, erratic bubbling
- Progress: 20-25% (declining)
- Reality: LATE but still viable

**Stage 5: Critical Failure (Explosion Risk)**
- Visual: Over-expansion, dark/smoky, violent shaking, red warnings
- Audio: Loud popping, hissing
- Progress: 5-10% (very weak) OR total failure if left too long
- Reality: CRITICAL - explosion imminent
- Waiting longer = explosion = recipe fails, 75% materials lost

### Ingredient Type Behaviors

**Stable Ingredients (Easy):**
- Slow predictable growth
- Smooth transitions, no false peaks
- Sweet spot: 2+ second window
- Easy to read, forgiving
- Example: Healing Herbs, Pure Water, Vegetables

**Moderate Ingredients (Medium):**
- Medium speed, some irregularity
- Occasional pulse variations (distractors)
- Sweet spot: 1.5 second window
- Some false indicators during Stage 2
- Example: Fire Flowers, Mineral Salts, Quality Meats

**Volatile Ingredients (Hard):**
- Fast erratic growth
- Multiple false glows during Stage 2
- Sweet spot: 1 second window
- Must distinguish real peak from fakes
- Example: Dragon Blood, Lightning Cores, Explosive Mushrooms

**Legendary Ingredients (Extreme):**
- Very fast, complex layered reactions
- Many false peaks, color shifts, cascading effects
- Sweet spot: 0.5-0.8 second window
- Requires extensive experience
- Example: Phoenix Ash, Void Essence, Eternity Bloom

### Advanced Mechanics

**Cascading Reactions (CRITICAL for T3-T4):**
- Previous ingredient's reaction quality affects next ingredient's timing
- Example: Fire ingredient added optimally → Water ingredient sweet spot shifts earlier
- Fire added late → Water sweet spot shifts later
- Creates dynamic gameplay - can't just memorize fixed timings
- Must adapt based on actual performance

**Ingredient Total Timers (Narrative Cooking Logic):**
- Some ingredients need longer total cooking time (hardy/base ingredients)
- Other ingredients are "finishing" ingredients (added near end)
- Hardy ingredients: Added first, can cook through multiple other reactions
- Finishing ingredients: Added last, short cooking time before stabilizing
- Example: Meat base cooks for 30s, herbs added at 25s as finisher

**Simultaneous Addition:**
- Can press multiple number keys at once to add multiple ingredients
- Useful for ingredients that should be combined
- Example: Press 2+3 together to add both Cooling Mint and Crystal Dust
- Creates combined reaction with blended properties
- Advanced technique for complex recipes

### Difficulty Scaling

**T1 Recipes:**
- 2-3 ingredients
- All stable or moderate
- No false peaks
- 2+ second sweet spot windows
- No cascading
- 60 second time limit

**T2 Recipes:**
- 3-5 ingredients
- Mix of stable and moderate
- 1-2 false peaks per ingredient
- 1.5 second sweet spot windows
- No cascading
- 45 second time limit

**T3 Recipes:**
- 5-7 ingredients
- Mix of moderate and volatile
- 2-3 false peaks per ingredient
- 1 second sweet spot windows
- Some cascading reactions
- 30 second time limit

**T4 Recipes:**
- 7-9 ingredients
- Volatile and legendary ingredients
- 4-5 false peaks per ingredient
- 0.5-0.8 second sweet spot windows
- Cascading reactions throughout
- Complex simultaneous additions required
- 20 second time limit

### Learning Curve (Experience-Based Pattern Recognition)

- Like learning when water truly boils vs just simmering
- Novice: Fooled by Stage 2 false peaks
- Intermediate: Recognizes Stage 3 sustained glow
- Expert: Feels the "harmonic convergence" at peak
- Audio cues become intuitive (resonant tone at sweet spot)
- Visual rhythm becomes internalized (steady pulse vs erratic)
- Each ingredient type has signature that becomes familiar

### Food vs Potions (Cosmetic Distinction)

- Same exact mechanics and minigame
- Different ingredient pools (food items vs alchemical reagents)
- Different aesthetic (cooking pot vs cauldron)
- Roughly equivalent power and duration
- Effects may slightly differ thematically but mechanically similar

### Important Disclaimers

- ALL numbers (timings, percentages, durations, effect strengths) are PLACEHOLDERS
- Example recipes are for demonstration only
- Guided-play will define actual values during balance testing
- Sweet spot windows, stage durations, progress contributions all subject to change
- System structure is final, numerical values are flexible

### Blank Canvas Assembly Process

**Step 1: Drag Slot Types**
- Start with empty canvas
- Drag desired slot types from palette onto canvas
- Can use same type multiple times (e.g., 2 POWER slots, 3 MODIFIER slots)
- Limited by station tier slot count (3, 5, 5, or 7 slots)
- Slot arrangement defines device structure

**Step 2: Fill Slots with Materials**
- Click each placed slot to add materials from inventory
- Each slot accepts specific material categories
- Materials stackable to 256 per slot
- System validates material compatibility with slot type

**Step 3: System Recognition**
- Once all slots filled, system analyzes combination
- FUNCTION slot material determines device category
- Other slots modify device stats and effects
- Shows preview: Known device OR "? Unknown Device ?"

**Step 4: Assembly/Experimentation**
- Known device: [Begin Assembly] → Puzzle sequence
- Unknown device: [Experiment] → Risk materials to discover
- Success: Device created, recipe learned (if new)
- Abandon: 50% materials returned, no device

### Device Type Determination (FUNCTION Slot)

```
[FRAME: Crystal Framework]
[POWER: Mana Core]
[FUNCTION: Fire Staff] ← Has "magic" + "fire" attributes
[MODIFIER: Amplifier]

```

### Material Rarity Impact

**Puzzle Count by Device Tier & Material Rarity:**
```
T1 Device (Common materials): 1-2 puzzles
T2 Device (Uncommon materials): 2-3 puzzles
T3 Device (Rare materials): 3-5 puzzles
T4 Device (Epic+ materials): 4-6 puzzles

Higher tier + higher rarity = more puzzles
```

**Sequential Solving:**
- Each puzzle affects different device stat
- Must solve all puzzles to complete device
- Solve in sequence: Puzzle 1 → Puzzle 2 → Puzzle 3 → etc.
- Each puzzle independently affects one aspect (accuracy, fire rate, durability, etc.)

**No Failure State:**
- Untimed - take as long as needed
- No material loss during puzzle solving
- Can attempt puzzle solution as many times as needed
- Optional: Move counter that resets puzzle if exceeded (soft limit, not failure)

**Only Ways to End Without Device:**
- ABANDON: Choose to give up, returns 50% materials, no device created
- Cannot solve puzzle: Eventually must abandon if stuck

### Multiple Puzzle Gauntlet System

**T1: Rotation Pipe Puzzles**
- Grid: 3x3 to 5x5
- Goal: Rotate pieces to connect input to output
- Pieces: Straight pipes, L-bends, T-junctions, crosses
- Constraint: All pieces must connect (no loose ends)
- Difficulty: Easy (3x3, obvious) → Hard (5x5, multiple paths, distractors)

**T2: Rotation + Sliding Tile Puzzles**
- Rotation: Same as T1 but harder (5x5, multiple inputs/outputs)
- Sliding Tiles: Classic sliding puzzle (3x3 or 4x4 grid with empty space)
- Goal: Arrange numbered tiles in order by sliding into empty space
- Difficulty: Easy (3x3, ~15 moves) → Hard (4x4, ~50+ moves)

**T3: Traffic Jam Puzzles**
- Grid: 6x6
- Pieces: Various sized blocks (1x2, 1x3, 2x2, 2x3)
- Goal: Slide target piece to exit by moving blocking pieces
- Pieces slide in direction of orientation only
- Difficulty: Medium (few pieces) → Very Hard (dense, 40+ moves, dead-ends)

**T4: Pattern Matching + Logic Grids**
- Pattern Matching: Complete partial patterns following rules (symmetry, no adjacent same, tiling)
- Logic Grids: Sudoku-style with engineering constraints (power flow, wiring, no loops)
- Grid: 5x5 to 9x9
- Multiple complex rules simultaneously
- Difficulty: Medium (simple rules, 5x5) → Extreme (many constraints, 9x9)

### Puzzle Completion (No Optimization System)

- Once puzzle solved, it's done - cannot retry for better result
- No "par" or optimal move count shown
- No stat bonus for efficient solutions
- Solve puzzle = that stat contribution locked in
- Device stats purely from material quality and slot configuration, NOT puzzle performance
- Puzzles are gateway/skill-check, not optimization minigame

### Save & Resume System

- Can save progress at any time during puzzle
- Click "Save & Exit" → puzzle state saved with current configuration
- Materials remain locked in station while saved
- Slot configuration and filled materials saved
- Can return later from exact same state
- No time penalty for saving/resuming
- Can have multiple devices in progress across different stations
- Example: T2 station with turret 40% done, T3 station with bomb 60% done

### Discovery System

- No blueprints - discovery through experimentation
- Try slot + material combinations
- System recognizes valid device patterns
- Unknown combinations show "? Unknown Device ?"
- Must experiment to discover new devices
- Successful discovery adds recipe to journal
- Recipe journal shows: Slot configuration + materials required
- Can recreate known devices easily after discovery

### Device Durability & Maintenance

**Turrets:**
- No ammo required
- Have durability/health bar
- Take damage when: Attacking (wear), being attacked (enemy damage)
- At 0 durability: Turret breaks, must be rebuilt
- Maintenance/Repair system: TBD (can repair in field or must return to station)
- Efficacy decreases as durability drops (like tools at 50%+ durability loss)

**Bombs:**
- Single-use consumable
- Explodes and consumed on use
- Casing can be recovered after explosion (material return)
- Example: Bomb uses 5 iron plates → After explosion, recover 2-3 iron plates

**Traps:**
- One-time use only
- Trigger once, then destroyed
- Must craft new trap to replace
- No material recovery

**Barriers/Walls:**
- Have durability/health
- Break when durability reaches 0
- Cannot repair (TBD - might allow repair later)

**Utility Devices:**
- Durability system TBD (might be permanent, might degrade)
- Balance decision: Should teleporters/collectors need maintenance?

### Deployment Limits

- Maximum 5 devices deployed simultaneously per player (static limit)
- Must destroy/remove existing device to place new one if at limit
- Applies across all device types (5 total, not 5 per type)
- Example: Can have 3 turrets + 2 traps, but not 3 turrets + 3 bombs
- Conservative limit for initial development, subject to balance changes

### Placement Freedom (UNIQUE TO ENGINEERING)

- Can place devices outside claimed territory
- Turrets/traps/bombs deployable anywhere accessible
- Creates tactical gameplay and forward positions
- Utility devices may still require claimed territory (TBD per device type)
- Tradeoff: Powerful but positional - once placed, devices are immobile

### Immobility & Tactical Positioning

- Devices cannot be picked up and moved after placement
- Must destroy and rebuild to relocate (lose durability investment)
- Encourages thoughtful placement
- Exception: Bombs are throwable/placeable before detonation

### Material Overlap (Critical Design Principle)

- Engineering shares MOST materials with other disciplines
- Only fringe/specialty materials are unique to engineering
- Material economy follows Venn diagram principle:
  - Core materials (iron, wood, fiber): Used in ALL 5 disciplines
  - Common materials (crystals, leather, stone): Used in 3-4 disciplines
  - Mid-tier materials (alloys, refined items): Used in 2-3 disciplines
  - Specialty materials (unique components): Used in 1 discipline only (rare)

### Important Disclaimers

- All device stats (damage, fire rate, durability) are PLACEHOLDERS
- Puzzle difficulty balance TBD through playtesting
- Device limits subject to change based on game balance
- Maintenance/repair systems may evolve during development
- Deployment restrictions per device type TBD

## Enchanting

### Base Mechanic & Purpose

- Make existing items stronger (weapons, armor, tools, turrets, anything craftable)
- Can also craft new accessories (rings, amulets, charms) from scratch

### Mini-Game Structure: Freeform Pattern Creation

- **Phase 1 - Placement:** Place enhancement materials anywhere in circular workspace (complete creative freedom, no grid/guides)
- **Phase 2 - Connection:** Draw lines between materials to create pattern
- **Phase 3 - Recognition:** System recognizes what geometric pattern was created
- **Phase 4 - Judgment:** System judges quality/precision of pattern (angle accuracy, spacing, symmetry)

### Material Types

- **Key materials:** Few materials that provide main enhancement properties (gems, essences, cores)
- **Connector materials:** Majority of materials used to form the pattern structure
- More total materials at higher tiers, but key materials remain few

### Pattern Recognition

- System detects geometric shapes (triangles, squares, stars, circles, spirals, nested patterns, etc.)
- Pattern type determines bonus type (offensive, defensive, utility, elemental)
- Pattern complexity determines bonus magnitude
- Pattern quality (precision) determines bonus strength percentage

### Complexity Scaling

- **Scales by grid detail:** Higher tiers have finer placement precision required
- T1: 3-5 materials, simple shapes, forgiving quality judgment
- T2: 6-8 materials, intermediate patterns, moderate precision needed
- T3: 9-12 materials, complex nested patterns, high precision required
- T4: 13-20 materials, multi-layered intricate patterns, pixel-perfect placement

### Discovery Element

Players discover what patterns create what effects through experimentation and experience

### Failure States

- Low-Mid tier: Enchanting materials consumed, item remains intact
- High tier: Materials consumed + item being enchanted BREAKS (high risk/reward)

### Specialization Branches

TBD based on pattern types players gravitate toward

## Cross-Crafting Systems

### Crafting Stations

**Tiered Workbench System (Universal Across All Disciplines):**
- **T1 Station (3x3 grid)**: Basic recipes, simple items
- **T2 Station (5x5 grid)**: Intermediate recipes, unlocks new item categories
- **T3 Station (7x7 grid)**: Advanced recipes, unlocks complex item types
- **T4 Station (9x9 grid)**: Master recipes, unlocks exotic/legendary items
- **Backward Compatibility**: T2 bench can craft all T1 recipes, T3 can craft T1+T2, etc.
- **Grid-Only Interface**: Crafting grid is primary/only interface (no additional UI complexity)

**Recipe Size = Item Quality:**
- **Small Recipes (3x3)**: Basic items, simple materials
- **Medium Recipes (5x5)**: Improved items, more materials = better stats
- **Large Recipes (7x7)**: Powerful items, complex material combinations
- **Massive Recipes (9x9)**: Legendary items, maximum material investment
- **Key Principle**: Same materials in larger recipe = better result
  - Example: Copper sword in 3x3 = basic | Copper greatsword in 5x5 = much better
- **No Stacking**: Each grid slot holds exactly 1 material (no quantity stacking)

**Material Tier Flexibility:**
- **Can use lower tier materials in higher tier benches**
- T1 materials in 7x7 recipe = excellent T1 item (better than simple T2 item)
- T3 materials in 9x9 recipe = god-tier T3 item
- Allows material investment to create exceptional lower-tier gear
- **Tier Mixing Allowed**: Can mix T1 + T2 + T3 in same recipe (affects quality metadata)

**Weapon/Item Type Unlocking:**
- **T1 Bench**: Shortswords, daggers, hand axes, basic armor
- **T2 Bench**: Longswords, battleaxes, spears, medium armor, unlocks "heavy" variants
- **T3 Bench**: Greatswords, warhammers, pikes, heavy armor, unlocks "exotic" variants  
- **T4 Bench**: Halberds, dual weapons, special armors, legendary item types
- **Narrative Logic**: Bigger weapons need bigger workspaces

**Station Requirements:**
- Each discipline needs dedicated station
- Stations are prerequisites for crafting (can't smith without forge)
- Starter stations (T1) provided/cheap to craft

**Station Upgrades:**
- Stations upgradable through their own crafting type
- Example: Forge has upgrade slots → Craft "Forge Enhancement" using smithing
- Each upgrade tier unlocks: Next tier recipes, Better +X potential, New mini-game mechanics
- Upgrades use same mini-game as their discipline
- **T4 is Maximum**: No infinite grid expansion beyond 9x9

**Station Placement:**
- Must be placed in claimed territory
- Size requirements (some stations bigger than others)
- Aesthetic variations (reflect player's crafting style?)

### Material Consumption & Failure

**Base Crafting (No Mini-Game):**
- 100% material consumption
- No failure possible
- Produces base item with no +X bonuses

**Mini-Game Crafting:**
- **Success:** 100% material consumption, item created with +X
- **Partial Success:** 100% material consumption, item created with reduced/no +X
- **Failure:** Partial material return or total loss (scales with tier)

**Failure Scaling:**
- T1 Failure: Lose 30-50% of materials
- T2 Failure: Lose 50-70% of materials
- T3 Failure: Lose 70-90% of materials
- T4 Failure: Lose 90-100% of materials
- High stakes at high tiers encourages skill development

**Multi-Attempt System:**
- 3 attempts per recipe instance
- All attempts use same material pool
- First attempt: Chance for unique "First-Try Bonus" attributes
- Subsequent attempts: Standard reward calculation, no bonus chance
- After 3 failures: Must gather new materials to try again

### Quality Tiers & +X System

**Base Item Stats:**
- Every item has base stats determined by recipe and materials
- Base stats are procedurally generated (guided-play defines ranges)
- Example: T2 Iron Sword base = 15-20 damage

**+X Bonus System:**
- Mini-game performance determines +X value
- +X adds to base stats
- Example: Perfect craft = +5 damage → Total 20-25 damage
- Higher tier items have higher potential +X (T4 could get +15)

**Quality Naming:**
- Normal: Base stats, no +X (instant craft)
- Fine: Base stats +1 to +3
- Superior: Base stats +4 to +7
- Masterwork: Base stats +8 to +12
- Legendary: Base stats +13+, possible unique attributes

**Attribute Bonuses:**
- Beyond stat +X, can gain special attributes
- Attributes from materials used (fire materials → fire damage)
- First-Try Bonus attributes (unique, rare)
- LLM-generated attributes (post guided-play)

### Recipe Discovery & Experimentation

**Guided-Play Recipes:**
- Pre-designed, hand-crafted recipes
- Unlocked through tutorial/early quests
- Establish baseline for material interactions
- ~20-30 recipes per discipline to start

**Experimentation Discovery:**
- Select materials → Attempt craft → Mini-game
- Success = Recipe learned + item created
- Failure = No recipe, some materials lost
- Can try any combination (no restrictions)

**Recipe Hints:**
- Item descriptions hint at uses
- Material combinations show "potential" indicator
- NPCs might suggest combinations
- Lore/books contain recipe clues

**LLM Recipe Generation:**
- Post guided-play, LLM generates new valid recipes
- Based on player's material usage patterns
- Validation: Must be balanced, must make thematic sense
- Player discovers through experimentation (LLM doesn't tell them directly)

**Recipe Book/Journal:**
- Personal recipe journal per player
- Records all discovered recipes
- Can instant-craft from journal (base quality)
- Shows materials required, expected output
- Tags/categories for organization
