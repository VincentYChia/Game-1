# Game Mechanics v3 - Complete Design Document

## üéØ VISION & CORE PHILOSOPHY

### Mission Statement
Create a 2D sandbox game that becomes a unique, infinite world for each player - one that understands how they think and adapts accordingly. Whether someone is an analytical optimizer who loves efficiency systems, a creative explorer who seeks discovery, or a social builder who enjoys collaboration, the game should recognize their cognitive style and procedurally generate content that resonates with how their mind works.

### The Infinite Promise
- **Infinite Resources** through procedural material generation that creates new crafting possibilities
- **Infinite Recipes** via algorithmic combination systems that generate personalized crafting trees  
- **Infinite Territory** through modular world building blocks that combine into endless unique regions
- **Infinite Progression** where mastery in one area opens entirely new systems and possibilities
- **Infinite Personalization** where the game learns player preferences and generates content tailored to their cognitive profile

### Technical Philosophy
Start with rock-solid, simple foundations (place tiles, craft items, automate systems) but architect every system to scale infinitely through data and algorithms, not code rewrites. Like Minecraft's blocks or No Man's Sky's planets - simple rules creating infinite emergent complexity.

**The Developer Challenge:** Build systems so robust and extensible that in 5 years, players could still be discovering new combinations, new territories, and new possibilities that surprise even us as the creators.

### Development Approach
**Current Phase:** Guided-play prototype (100√ó100 world, T1-T3 content, hand-crafted recipes establishing baseline patterns)

**Guided-Play Style:** BOTW/Minecraft approach - hints and info bubbles, but complete freedom from the start. No forced tutorial sequences. Easy start with core mechanics, gradually opens to full freedom after 3 NPCs.

**Future Phase:** LLM-driven infinite content generation begins post-guided-play, creating personalized progression, emergent specializations, and unique discoveries based on player behavior patterns.

## üåç WORLD STRUCTURE & LAYOUT

### **Development World (100√ó100 Units)**

**Total Playable Area:** 100√ó100 units
- **Purpose:** Guided-play development region (prototype for larger world)
- **Grid System:** Continuous float positions with snap-to-unit for collision detection
- **3D-Ready Architecture:** All positions use {x, y, z} format where z=0 for 2D (ready for 3D conversion)
- **Future Expansion:** Post-guided-play opens to infinite procedural world generation
- **Boundaries:** None for now (players can walk to edges, system will expand later)

**Why 100√ó100:**
- Large enough for ~20 hours of guided-play content
- Small enough for performance testing and iteration
- Provides baseline data for LLM training
- Easy to expand without rewriting core systems

---

### **Chunk-Based Generation System**

**Chunk Structure:**
- **Chunk Size:** 16√ó16 units each
- **Total Chunks:** 6√ó6 grid = 36 chunks (with 4 unit border/padding for roads and transitions)
- **Generation Method:** Procedural, each chunk independently rolls for type
- **Seed-Based:** Reproducible world generation using seed values (for save/load consistency)

**Chunk Type Distribution:**

Roll d8 for each chunk during world generation:
```
1 = MOB CHUNK (12.5% chance - high enemy density, combat focus)
2 = FOREST CHUNK (12.5% chance - dense tree coverage)
3 = STONE CHUNK (12.5% chance - dense stone and elemental nodes)
4 = ORE CHUNK (12.5% chance - dense metal ore deposits)
5-8 = GRASSLAND CHUNK (50% chance - mixed balanced resources)

Result: Half the world is balanced grassland, half is specialized biomes
```

**Design Rationale:**
- Specialization chunks reward exploration (venture to forest for wood efficiency)
- Grassland chunks provide baseline of all resources (never stuck)
- MOB chunks create optional high-risk, high-reward areas
- 1/8 distribution ensures varied world without too much specialization

## üéØ GATHERING SYSTEM

### **Core Interaction Loop**

Player ‚Üí Resource Node Interaction Flow:
```
1. Player moves near resource node using WASD controls
2. System checks distance: Within 3 unit interaction radius?
3. Player clicks on resource node (mouse click on sprite/hitbox)
4. System validates:
   - Does player have correct tool type equipped? (Axe for trees, Pickaxe for ore/stone)
   - Is tool tier sufficient? (T1 tool can mine T1, struggles with T2+)
5. If valid: Tool "hits" resource
   - Visual: Resource node shakes/vibrates
   - Audio: Impact sound (wood thunk, stone crack, metal clang)
   - Particles: Material-specific particles spawn (wood chips, stone dust, ore sparkles)
   - Damage: Resource health bar depletes based on effective damage calculation
6. Repeat: Player clicks again for next hit (or holds mouse for continuous hitting)
7. Resource health reaches 0:
   - Node destruction animation plays (tree falls, stone crumbles, ore shatters)
   - Materials drop (RNG quantity based on resource size and tier)
   - Materials scatter on ground in 2-3 unit radius around node
   - Materials glow/shimmer for visibility
8. Collection: Player clicks scattered materials (1 unit pickup radius)
   - Materials automatically add to inventory (if space available)
   - Collection sound plays (satisfying chime/pickup noise)
   - Quantity notification appears briefly ("+5 Oak Logs")
9. Node disappears: Resource entity removed from world (no respawn for now)
10. Player continues: Find next resource, repeat loop
```

**Design Philosophy:**
- Click-to-gather feels rewarding (each hit is player action)
- Health bars provide clear progress feedback
- Visual/audio feedback makes gathering satisfying
- Material drop creates micro-moment of "loot collection" excitement
- No respawn creates sense of world impact (you're actually consuming resources)

---

### **Tool Tier Efficiency System**

**The Core Formula:**
```
Effective Damage = Base Tool Damage √ó Tool Tier Efficiency √ó Stat Multiplier √ó Title Multiplier √ó Equipment Multiplier

Where:
- Base Tool Damage: Tier-based flat value (T1 = 10, T2 = 20, T3 = 40, T4 = 80)
- Tool Tier Efficiency: Multiplicative modifier based on resource tier vs tool tier
- Stat Multiplier: 1 + (relevant stat points √ó stat bonus %)
- Title Multiplier: Cumulative from all earned titles
- Equipment Multiplier: Product of all equipment bonuses
```

**Tool Tier Efficiency Rules:**
```
Gathering SAME Tier Resource (Optimal):
- Efficiency: 100% (no modifier)
- Example: T2 Axe (20 base) vs T2 Tree (200 HP)
  - Effective Damage: 20 √ó 1.0 = 20 damage/hit
  - Hits to Deplete: 200 HP √∑ 20 = 10 hits
  - Result: Fast, efficient, feels good

Gathering ONE TIER HIGHER Resource (+1, Slow but Viable):
- Efficiency: 50% (half damage)
- Example: T1 Axe (10 base) vs T2 Tree (200 HP)
  - Effective Damage: 10 √ó 0.5 = 5 damage/hit
  - Hits to Deplete: 200 HP √∑ 5 = 40 hits  
  - Result: 4x slower, significant time investment, but POSSIBLE
  - Design: Allows progression without hard gates, rewards upgrading tools

Gathering TWO+ TIERS HIGHER Resource (+2+, Not Practical):
- Efficiency: 10% (one-tenth damage)
- Example: T1 Axe (10 base) vs T3 Tree (400 HP)
  - Effective Damage: 10 √ó 0.1 = 1 damage/hit
  - Hits to Deplete: 400 HP √∑ 1 = 400 hits
  - Result: Absurdly slow, not worth attempting
  - Design: Soft blocks progression (technically possible, practically insane)

Gathering LOWER Tier Resources (Efficient Farming):
- Efficiency: 150%+ (bonus damage, overkill)
- Example: T3 Axe (40 base) vs T1 Tree (100 HP)
  - Effective Damage: 40 √ó 1.5 = 60 damage/hit
  - Hits to Deplete: 100 HP √∑ 60 = 1.67 hits (basically 2 hits)
  - Result: 5x faster than same-tier, trivializes low-tier gathering
  - Design: Returning to starter areas for materials doesn't feel tedious
```

**Why This System Works:**
- **Natural Progression:** Players can attempt higher tiers but it's painful
- **Meaningful Upgrades:** New tools make dramatic difference (10 hits ‚Üí 2 hits)
- **No Hard Walls:** Can't be permanently stuck (just slow progression)
- **Backtracking Reward:** High-tier tools make low-tier gathering trivial
- **Clear Feedback:** Players FEEL the difference between tier matches

---

### **Resource Health Scaling**

**Base Health by Tier (Doubling Pattern):**
```
T1 Resources: 100 HP base
- Oak Tree, Pine Tree, Limestone, Copper Ore, etc.
- Rationale: 10 hits with T1 tool (10 damage √ó 10 hits = 100 HP)

T2 Resources: 200 HP base (2x)
- Birch Tree, Maple Tree, Granite, Steel Ore, etc.
- Rationale: 10 hits with T2 tool (20 damage √ó 10 hits = 200 HP)

T3 Resources: 400 HP base (2x)
- Ironwood Tree, Obsidian, Mithril Ore, etc.
- Rationale: 10 hits with T3 tool (40 damage √ó 10 hits = 400 HP)

T4 Resources: 800 HP base (2x)
- World Tree, Star Crystal, Eternium Ore, etc.
- Rationale: 10 hits with T4 tool (80 damage √ó 10 hits = 800 HP)
```

**Design Goal:** Same-tier gathering always takes approximately 10 hits (consistent feedback)

---

### **Size Variance (Exponential Scaling)**

**Visual Size Categories with Exponential Rewards:**
```
SMALL Resources (0.8x sprite scale):
- HP Modifier: 0.8x (Example: T1 = 80 HP instead of 100 HP)
- Yield Modifier: 0.8x (Example: 3-5 logs instead of 4-6 logs)
- Efficiency: 0.8 HP per material (100 HP √∑ 100 materials = 1:1 ratio)
- Visual: Noticeably smaller sprite
- Rationale: Quick to gather but lower yield, good for emergency materials

NORMAL Resources (1.0x sprite scale):
- HP Modifier: 1.0x (Example: T1 = 100 HP)
- Yield Modifier: 1.0x (Example: 4-6 logs)
- Efficiency: 1.0 HP per material (baseline ratio)
- Visual: Standard sprite size
- Rationale: Most common, balanced risk/reward

LARGE Resources (1.5x sprite scale):
- HP Modifier: 1.5x (Example: T1 = 150 HP)
- Yield Modifier: 1.5x (Example: 7-10 logs)
- Efficiency: 1.0 HP per material (same ratio, but more total)
- Visual: Noticeably larger sprite
- Rationale: Takes 50% longer but gives 50% more (proportional, worth it)

HUGE Resources (2.5x sprite scale):
- HP Modifier: 2.5x (Example: T1 = 250 HP)
- Yield Modifier: 2.5x (Example: 12-18 logs)
- Efficiency: SLIGHTLY BETTER (exponential bonus starts here)
- Visual: Massive sprite, stands out dramatically
- Rationale: Takes 2.5x time but gives 2.5x+ reward (slight efficiency bonus rewards finding huge nodes)
```

**Exponential Scaling Example (T1 Oak Tree):**
```
Small Oak (80 HP):
- Time: 8 hits
- Yield: 3-4 logs average
- Efficiency: 20 HP per log (worse than normal)

Normal Oak (100 HP):
- Time: 10 hits
- Yield: 4-5 logs average
- Efficiency: 22 HP per log (baseline)

Large Oak (150 HP):
- Time: 15 hits
- Yield: 7-9 logs average
- Efficiency: 19 HP per log (slightly better)

Huge Oak (250 HP):
- Time: 25 hits
- Yield: 14-18 logs average
- Efficiency: 16 HP per log (BEST efficiency)
```

**Design Intent:**
- Small nodes: Quick emergency resources but inefficient
- Normal nodes: Balanced, most common
- Large nodes: Worth targeting (same efficiency, more total)
- Huge nodes: BEST efficiency, reward exploration and observation
- Visual feedback: Can identify valuable nodes from distance

---

### **Tool Damage Scaling (Matches Resource Health)**

```
T1 Tools: 10 damage per hit
- Example: T1 Pickaxe, T1 Axe
- Result: 10 hits to deplete T1 resource (100 HP √∑ 10 = 10)

T2 Tools: 20 damage per hit (2x)
- Example: T2 Pickaxe, T2 Axe
- Result: 10 hits to deplete T2 resource (200 HP √∑ 20 = 10)

T3 Tools: 40 damage per hit (2x)
- Example: T3 Pickaxe, T3 Axe
- Result: 10 hits to deplete T3 resource (400 HP √∑ 40 = 10)

T4 Tools: 80 damage per hit (2x)
- Example: T4 Pickaxe, T4 Axe
- Result: 10 hits to deplete T4 resource (800 HP √∑ 80 = 10)
```

**Perfect Symmetry:** Tool damage doubles when health doubles, maintaining 10-hit baseline across all tiers.

---

### **Material Yield System (RNG with Luck Influence)**

**Yield Ranges by Tier and Size:**
```
T1 Resources:
- Small: 2-4 materials (avg 3)
- Normal: 3-5 materials (avg 4)
- Large: 5-8 materials (avg 6.5)
- Huge: 10-15 materials (avg 12.5)

T2 Resources:
- Small: 3-5 materials (avg 4)
- Normal: 5-7 materials (avg 6)
- Large: 8-12 materials (avg 10)
- Huge: 15-22 materials (avg 18.5)

T3 Resources (proportional increase):
- Small: 5-7 materials
- Normal: 8-10 materials
- Large: 12-18 materials
- Huge: 22-32 materials

T4 Resources (proportional increase):
- Small: 8-12 materials
- Normal: 12-16 materials
- Large: 20-30 materials
- Huge: 35-50 materials
```

**Luck Stat Influence:**
```
Base RNG: Random(min, max) using uniform distribution
Luck Effect: Shifts distribution toward maximum value

Formula: 
final_yield = min + (max - min) √ó (base_random + LCK_bonus)
where LCK_bonus = LCK_stat √ó 0.02

Example: Normal T2 Tree (5-7 logs), Player has 15 LCK
- Base roll: Random(0.0 to 1.0) = 0.5
- LCK Bonus: 15 √ó 0.02 = 0.30
- Adjusted: 0.5 + 0.30 = 0.80 (capped at 1.0)
- Result: 5 + (7-5) √ó 0.80 = 5 + 1.6 = 6.6 logs ‚Üí 7 logs (rounded up)

Zero Luck (0 LCK):
- Uniform distribution, equal chance of any value in range
- Average yield over time

High Luck (20+ LCK):
- Heavily biased toward maximum values
- Almost always get max or near-max yields
- Dramatic difference in material accumulation over time
```

**Design Philosophy:**
- Base RNG prevents predictability (keeps gathering interesting)
- Luck stat rewards builds focused on resource acquisition
- High luck builds become "farmer" specialists (gather more per node)
- Still random (never guaranteed), just statistically better

---

### **Complete Gathering Example (With All Multipliers)**

**Scenario: Player gathering Huge T2 Birch Tree (500 HP)**

**Player Build:**
- Tool: T2 Axe (20 base damage)
- Stats: 12 AGI (forestry bonus +5% per point)
- Title: Apprentice Lumberjack (+25% forestry)
- Equipment: Forestry Gloves (+10%), no other bonuses
- LCK: 8 (affects yield)

**Damage Calculation:**
```
Base Tool Damage: 20 (T2 Axe)

Tool Tier Efficiency: 1.0 (T2 tool vs T2 resource, perfect match)

Stat Multiplier:
- AGI: 12 points √ó 5% = +60%
- Multiplier: 1.60

Title Multiplier:
- Apprentice Lumberjack: +25%
- Multiplier: 1.25

Equipment Multiplier:
- Forestry Gloves: +10%
- Multiplier: 1.10

Total Effective Damage:
20 √ó 1.0 √ó 1.60 √ó 1.25 √ó 1.10 = 44 damage per hit
```

**Hits Required:**
```
Resource HP: 500 (Huge T2 tree = 200 base √ó 2.5 size)
Damage per Hit: 44
Hits Needed: 500 √∑ 44 = 11.36 hits ‚Üí 12 hits

Compare to Base (no bonuses):
- Base damage: 20
- Hits needed: 500 √∑ 20 = 25 hits
- Specialized build is MORE THAN 2x faster (12 vs 25 hits)
```

**Yield Calculation:**
```
Huge T2 Tree Base Range: 15-22 logs

Luck Influence (8 LCK):
- LCK Bonus: 8 √ó 0.02 = 0.16
- Base Roll: Random(0-1) = 0.60 (example)
- Adjusted: 0.60 + 0.16 = 0.76
- Yield: 15 + (22-15) √ó 0.76 = 15 + 5.32 = 20.32 ‚Üí 20 logs

Compare to No Luck:
- Average yield: (15+22)/2 = 18.5 logs
- With 8 LCK: Averaging ~19-20 logs (noticeable improvement)
```

**Total Result:**
- Hits: 12 (vs 25 base, 52% faster)
- Yield: 20 logs (vs 18.5 average, 8% more)
- Time Saved: If each hit takes 0.5 seconds, saves 6.5 seconds per tree
- Over 100 trees: Saves 650 seconds (10+ minutes of clicking)

**Design Validation:**
- Specialization feels VERY rewarding (dramatic time savings)
- Stats, titles, equipment all stack multiplicatively (big numbers)
- Luck provides consistent edge (not random spikes, steady improvement)
- High-investment builds pay off clearly

### **Visual & Audio Feedback**

**During Gathering (Per Hit):**
```
Visual Feedback:
- Resource node shakes/vibrates (0.2 second duration)
- Particle effects spawn at impact point:
  - Trees: Wood chips (brown/tan particles, scatter outward)
  - Stone: Dust clouds (gray/white particles, puff upward)
  - Ore: Sparkles (metallic glints, shimmer effect)
- Health bar appears above node:
  - Red bar depleting left to right
  - Current HP / Max HP displayed numerically
  - Bar color changes based on % (green > yellow > orange > red)
- Critical Hit (if triggered):
  - Larger particle burst
  - Screen shake (subtle, 1 pixel)
  - "CRIT!" text popup with damage number
  - Different impact sound (deeper/louder)

Audio Feedback:
- Impact sound varies by material:
  - Wood: Solid "thunk" (satisfying chop)
  - Stone: Sharp "crack" (brittle break)
  - Ore: Metallic "clang" (mining ring)
- Volume scales with damage dealt (higher damage = louder)
- Critical hits play enhanced sound effect
- Pitch variation (slight random pitch shift prevents monotony)
```

**On Resource Depletion (Node Destroyed):**
```
Visual Feedback:
- Destruction animation:
  - Trees: Fall in random direction, fade out during fall
  - Stone: Crumble into pieces, pieces sink into ground
  - Ore: Shatter with sparkle burst, fragments disappear
- Materials drop:
  - Items spawn at node position
  - Scatter in 2-3 unit radius (random positions)
  - Items appear with "pop-in" animation (scale from 0 to 1)
  - Glow effect around items (make them obvious)
  - Shimmer particles above items (draw attention)
- Experience gain notification:
  - "+10 EXP" floats upward from node position
  - Fades out while floating (3 second duration)

Audio Feedback:
- Destruction sound:
  - Trees: Timber creak ‚Üí crash (satisfying fall)
  - Stone: Heavy crumble (boulder break)
  - Ore: Crystal shatter (high-pitch tinkle)
- Material drop sound: Soft "plink" as items hit ground
- Experience chime: Pleasant notification tone
```

**Material Collection (Pickup):**
```
Visual Feedback:
- Item highlights when mouse hover (outline glow)
- On click: Item flies toward player character
  - Parabolic arc animation (looks natural)
  - Scales down during flight (perspective)
  - Disappears when reaching player
- Inventory slot briefly highlights (item added)
- If inventory full: Red "X" appears, item stays on ground

Audio Feedback:
- Collection chime: Pleasant "ding" or "pop" sound
- Different pitch per material type (wood lower, ore higher)
- If inventory full: Error "bonk" sound

Text Feedback:
- Quantity notification appears briefly:
  - "+5 Oak Logs" (material name + quantity)
  - Position: Above player character or bottom-center screen
  - Duration: 2 seconds, fades out
  - Stacks if collecting multiple materials quickly
```

**Critical Hit System (Luck-Based):**
```
Trigger Chance:
- Base: 5% chance per hit
- LCK Bonus: +2% per LCK point
- Example: 15 LCK = 5% + 30% = 35% crit chance

Critical Effect:
- Damage: 2x normal damage (before multipliers)
- Visual: Enhanced particle burst, screen shake
- Audio: Deeper/louder impact sound
- Text: "CRIT!" popup with yellow damage number

Design Purpose:
- Adds excitement to repetitive clicking
- Rewards LCK builds (high crit chance)
- Occasional fast node depletion (satisfying surprise)
- Makes gathering feel less monotonous
```

### **Interaction Range & Position System**

**Position Architecture (3D-Ready):**
```javascript
Position Object Structure:
{
  x: float  // World X coordinate (continuous, sub-unit precision)
  y: float  // World Y coordinate (continuous)
  z: float  // World Z coordinate (currently 0 for 2D, ready for 3D)
}

Distance Calculation (3D formula, works in 2D when z=0):
distance(pos1, pos2) = ‚àö[(x‚ÇÅ-x‚ÇÇ)¬≤ + (y‚ÇÅ-y‚ÇÇ)¬≤ + (z‚ÇÅ-z‚ÇÇ)¬≤]

Current 2D Usage:
distance(pos1, pos2) = ‚àö[(x‚ÇÅ-x‚ÇÇ)¬≤ + (y‚ÇÅ-y‚ÇÇ)¬≤]
(z components ignored since z=0 for both)
```

**Interaction System:**
```
Player Position: Continuous float coordinates
- Example: Player at (47.3, 52.8, 0)
- Moves smoothly between units
- WASD controls update position in small increments (0.1 units per frame)

Resource Node Position: Snap-to-grid integer coordinates
- Example: Tree at (48, 53, 0)
- Always positioned on whole number coordinates
- Makes pathfinding and collision simpler

Interaction Range Check:
IF distance(player_pos, node_pos) <= 3.0 THEN
  node is interactable (highlight, can click)
ELSE
  node not interactable (grayed out, cannot click)

Visual Feedback:
- Nodes within range: Full color, outline glow on hover
- Nodes out of range: Slightly dimmed, no interaction possible
- Range indicator: Optional circle around player (3 unit radius, toggle in settings)
```
**Snap-to-Grid for Collision:**
```
Movement Collision Detection:
1. Player tries to move from (47.3, 52.8) to (47.4, 52.8)
2. System checks "snap position": floor(47.4, 52.8) = (47, 52)
3. Check if tile (47, 52) is solid/occupied
4. If clear: Allow movement to (47.4, 52.8)
5. If blocked: Prevent movement, player stays at (47.3, 52.8)

Design Rationale:
- Continuous float positions = smooth movement
- Snap-to-grid collision = simple, predictable physics
- Resources on grid = easy pathfinding
- Ready for 3D (just add z-axis checks)
```

**Visual Range Indicator:**
```
Optional UI Element (can be toggled):
- Circle drawn around player (3 unit radius)
- Shows exact interaction range
- Helps new players understand mechanics
- Can be disabled in settings for cleaner visuals
```

---

### **Tool Durability Consumption**

**Simple 1:1 System:**
```
Each resource hit = 1 durability consumed

Example:
T2 Tree (200 HP) with T2 Axe (20 damage):
- Requires 10 hits to deplete
- Consumes 10 durability

Result: Predictable, easy to understand
```

**Durability Ranges by Tier:**
```
T1 Tools: 500 durability
- Can harvest ~50 same-tier resources
- Breaking should be rare for new players

T2 Tools: 1,000 durability  
- Can harvest ~50 same-tier resources
- Higher tier = more durable

T3 Tools: 2,000 durability
- Can harvest ~50 same-tier resources
- Very durable, long-lasting

T4 Tools: 4,000 durability
- Can harvest ~50 same-tier resources
- Extremely rare to break
```

**Wrong Tool Penalty:**
```
Using pickaxe in combat = 2x durability drain
Using sword to mine = 5x durability drain (or impossible)

Design: Encourages using right tool for job
```

**0% Durability Behavior:**
```
Tool never breaks completely
At 0% durability: Functions at 50% effectiveness
- T2 Axe at 0%: 10 damage instead of 20 damage
- Still usable, just slower
- Can repair at any time

Philosophy: No punishment for running out, just inefficiency
```

**Repair System:**
```
Where: Workstations only (appropriate discipline)
Cost: 20% of original crafting materials
Preserves: All mini-game bonuses and attributes
Time: Instant (no mini-game for repairs)

Example:
T2 Iron Pickaxe repair from 0% to 100%:
- Original cost: 5 Iron Ingots, 2 Oak Planks
- Repair cost: 1 Iron Ingot, 1 Oak Plank (20%)
- Keeps: +15% mining speed from mini-game craft
```

## üìä PROGRESSION SYSTEMS

### Character Stats System

**Core Design:**

**Character Levels (VERY SLOW - 20 Hours Total):**

**Max Level:** 30 (1 stat point per level = 30 total stat points)

**Exponential EXP Requirements:**
```
Level 1 ‚Üí 2:      200 EXP
Level 2 ‚Üí 3:      350 EXP

```

**EXP Sources (Exponential by Tier, 4x Multiplier):**

**Gathering:**
```
T1 Resource:    10 EXP base
T2 Resource:    40 EXP base (4x)
T3 Resource:   160 EXP base (4x)
T4 Resource:   640 EXP base (4x)

Size Modifiers:
- Small:  0.8x
- Normal: 1.0x
- Large:  1.5x
- Huge:   2.5x

Example: Huge T2 Tree = 40 √ó 2.5 = 100 EXP per gather
```

---

### Skill System (Active Abilities)

**[NEEDS DEVELOPMENT] - Base mechanics finalized, full library TBD**

**Core Design:**
- **Skills are activated effects** (NOT passive bonuses - titles give passives)
- **Frenzy/Burst mechanics** (temporary powerful boosts)
- **Cooldown-based** (can't spam, strategic usage)
- **Consume Mana** (INT-based resource pool)
- **Progress slowly** (late-game EXP sink, slower than character levels)

**Skill Progression:**
```
Max Skill Level: 10 (Very Slow)

Level 1:   1,000 Skill EXP
Level 2:   2,000 Skill EXP
Level 3:   4,000 Skill EXP
Level 4:   8,000 Skill EXP
...
Level 10: 512,000 Skill EXP

Total to Max: ~1,000,000 Skill EXP per skill
(Much slower than character leveling - late game content)
```

**Skill EXP Sources:**
```
Using the skill: 100 EXP per activation

Activity while skill active (bonus EXP):
- T1 activity:    20 Skill EXP
- T2 activity:    80 Skill EXP
- T3 activity:   320 Skill EXP
- T4 activity: 1,280 Skill EXP
```

**Mana System:**
```
Mana Pool:
- Base: 100 mana
- Per INT Point: +20 mana
- Per Character Level: +10 mana

Example (15 INT, Level 20):
100 + (15 √ó 20) + (20 √ó 10) = 600 mana

Mana Regeneration:
- Base: 10 mana/minute
- Per INT Point: +2 mana/minute

Example (15 INT):
10 + (15 √ó 2) = 40 mana/minute
```

**Design Intent:**
- Early players can freely experiment (Level 1-10)
- Mid-game switching is costly but possible
- Endgame switching is for major playstyle changes only
- Losing titles makes switching extremely painful
- Encourages making alt characters instead

---

### Equipment Progression

**Tier System:**
- T1 ‚Üí T2 ‚Üí T3 ‚Üí T4 based on material tier + recipe complexity
- Higher tier materials + larger recipes = more powerful items
- T1 maxed (high rarity + mini-game perfection) can compete with basic T2

**Equipment Types:**
- **Armor:** Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots, Gauntlets (5 slots)
- **Weapons:** Main Hand, Off Hand
- **Accessories:** 1 slot (rings/amulets/charms from Enchanting)
- **Tools:** Pickaxe slot, Axe slot (quick-swap, not counted in combat slots)

**Upgrade vs Replace:**
- **Enchanting** upgrades existing gear (adds bonuses, can fail at high tier)
- **Crafting new** replaces old gear (better base stats)
- Both paths viable

## üîß TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Position System (3D-Ready)
```javascript
Position {
  x: float,
  y: float,
  z: float  // Currently 0 for 2D, ready for 3D
}

distance(pos1, pos2) = ‚àö[(x‚ÇÅ-x‚ÇÇ)¬≤ + (y‚ÇÅ-y‚ÇÇ)¬≤ + (z‚ÇÅ-z‚ÇÇ)¬≤]

Current 2D usage: z=0 for both positions
```

### Renderer Abstraction
```javascript
interface IRenderer {
  renderWorld(worldSystem: WorldSystem): void
  renderCharacter(character: Character): void
  renderUI(uiData: any): void
  handleResize(width, height): void
}

// Current: Canvas2DRenderer implements IRenderer
// Future: WebGL3DRenderer implements IRenderer (drop-in replacement)
```

### Asset Management
```javascript
AssetDefinition {
  id: string,
  name: string,
  sprite2D: "path.png",      // Current
  model3D: "path.gltf",      // Future
  color: "#hex",             // Fallback
  scale: number              // 3D scaling
}
```

### Input System
- Mouse ‚Üí world coordinates via viewport.screenToWorld()
- WASD movement (updates character position)
- Hotkeys 1-6 for skills
- Ready for 3D ray casting (future)

- Every character level (progression snapshot)

Save data includes:
- World state (all tiles, resources, placed objects)
- Player state (position, stats, level, EXP)
- Inventory (all items, quantities)
- Equipment (what's equipped)
- Progression (skills, titles, quest progress)
- Playtime tracking

Format: JSON or binary (TBD based on size/performance)

**üìã TOTAL TBD ITEMS:** 20 major systems + numerous subsystems

---

## üéì KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES

1. **Simple Rules, Infinite Complexity:** Basic mechanics scale infinitely through data and algorithms
2. **No Hard Caps:** Balance through careful tuning, not artificial limits (except max level 30 for stats)
3. **Player Agency:** Everything optional (mini-games can be skipped, class switching allowed, skills can be evolved or kept)
4. **3D-Ready Architecture:** All systems support seamless 2D‚Üí3D transition (Position objects, renderer abstraction, asset management)
5. **LLM-Enhanced Longevity:** Guided-play establishes patterns, LLM generates infinite personalized content
6. **Specialization Rewards:** Deep focus yields unique personalized content (titles, skills, recipes)
7. **No Breaking:** Durability declines but never destroys items (0% = 50% effectiveness forever)
8. **Multiplicative Scaling:** Stats √ó Titles √ó Equipment = exponential power growth
9. **EXP = Engagement:** Only mini-games grant crafting EXP (encourages active, skilled play)
10. **Placeholder Philosophy:** All numerical values subject to refinement during balance testing

---

**This document represents the complete game design as of this phase. Crafting systems are fully detailed. Progression systems are finalized. Material and world structure are defined. Recipe and skill libraries need future development using similar systematic approaches.**

## üìù OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS & DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

**World Structure & NPCs (Current Focus):**
1. Is 500√ó500 tiles the right size for starting region, or adjust?
2. Should resource nodes be visible from distance, or require exploration?
3. Should NPC locations have map markers from start, or reveal through gameplay?
4. Minimap system needed now, or defer?
5. Is 3-NPC structure enough for guided-play?
6. Should 3rd discipline choice at NPC 3 be permanent, or eventually learn all?
7. Should enemies exist in guided-play region?
8. What happens at world boundaries - walls, danger zones, or messages?

**Future Design Sessions:**
- **Recipes & Crafting Content:** Define T1-T4 recipe sets for all disciplines
- **Skill Library:** Design 100+ active abilities with varied mechanics
- **Combat Expansion:** Full system beyond placeholder T1 combat
- **Exploration & Biomes:** Post-guided-play world generation
- **Building & Territory:** Multi-tile structures and claiming mechanics
- **LLM Integration:** Exact triggers and validation for procedural content

**Current Status:** Core systems designed. Ready to define specific content (recipes, skills, world layout).
